TI ProcessCarbonAgent: A large language models-empowered autonomous agent for decision-making in manufacturing carbon emission management

AB Knowledge-intensive production represents a primary trend in industrial manufacturing, which heavily relies on the production logs of large-scale, historically similar orders for enhancing production efficiency and process quality. These logs are essential for predicting resource allocation and identifying bottlenecks in throughput. As a result, root cause analysis of the production process state is crucial for supporting decision-making in these settings. However, current methodologies heavily depend on expert knowledge, making the analysis time-consuming and inefficient for large-scale, multivariable processes. Although the development of large language models and autonomous agents presents a potential solution, these models are limited in their direct interaction with event logs due to inadequate data representation, token constraints, and insufficient accuracy. Therefore, enabling the interactive capabilities of large language models to overcome these specific limitations in process event data and industrial domain illusions poses a significant challenge. To address these issues, this paper introduces the ProcessCarbonAgent framework, an autonomous agent empowered by large language models, designed to enhance decision-making within industrial processes. Initially, a process data agent combines predefined semantic text representation methods with process template prompting strategies to improve interaction capabilities. Subsequently, an intention agent utilizing self-information and large language models is developed to address context length limitations by identifying and eliminating redundancies. Finally, a two-stage confidence estimation method is implemented to refine the precision of decision-making assistance, thereby improving the accuracy of decisions supported by large language models. Experiments with textile industry carbon emission data reveal that the assisted decision-making scores employing a compression ratio of 0.5, closely align with scores from manually labeled evaluations, with a 98% overlap across scoring intervals. Moreover, in contrast to relying solely on the original evaluation method, the two-stage confidence estimation method has led to a 20% increase in accuracy performance. The ProcessCarbonAgent achieved scores of 16.64, 55.13, 26.32, and 34.17 on METEOR, BERTScore, NUBIA, and BLEURT, respectively. The results demonstrate that the ProcessCarbonAgent framework significantly enhances the decision-making process for high-carbon emission states in industrial production, providing technical support for the low-carbon transformation and intelligent upgrading of these processes.

AB In recent decades, there has been a substantial rise in both worldwide energy consumption and the accompanying increase in Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions, primarily propelled by population growth and the escalating demand for personal comfort. Operational energy consumption in buildings constitutes about 30% of the world's total final energy usage, underscoring the significance of predicting building energy usage for effective energy planning, management, and conservation. This study has enhanced the prediction of heating load (HL) and cooling loads (CL) for residential buildings using novel and dependable machine learning (ML) techniques. The study utilized two base models: Adaptive Boosting (ADA) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). An ensemble consisting of ADA and XGB was constructed to improve the model's performance, aligning with the principles of the Dempster-Shafer theory. To optimize the efficiency of ADA and XGB, five innovative optimizers, namely Victoria Amazonica Optimization (VAO), Giant Trevally Optimizer (GTO), Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMAES), Coyote Optimization Algorithm (COA), and Mountain Gazelle Optimizer (MGO), were integrated. Statistical analysis has been employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. The results highlight the effectiveness of CMAES in optimizing the XGB and ADA models for predicting HL and CL. The most accurate result was achieved by the XGCM hybrid model, as evidenced by the impressive total R2 value of 0.9934 in HL and 0.9911 in CL prediction. The experimental findings illustrate that the suggested approach exhibits superior predictive performance across various scenarios of building energy consumption.

TI A machine learning approach to analysis of Canadian provincial power system decarbonization
SO ENERGY REPORTS
LA English

DE Provincial policy planning; Decarbonization pathways; Energy systems modeling; machine learning
AB Canada committed to reducing national greenhouse gas emissions by 40-45 % by 2030 and achieving net-zero by 2050, relying on low-carbon electrification across economic sectors. This study investigates the machine learning's potential to analyze least-cost optimization of Canadian provincial power systems to 2050, to identify robust pathways for net-zero electricity system greenhouse gas emissions, and to provide policy insights respecting wind and solar generation, reducing emissions from natural gas generation, and expanding interprovincial transmission. Surrogate modeling is applied as sensitivities to generation technology capital costs, electricity demand, and carbon pricing to results from an existing capacity expansion mixed-integer linear optimization model. Under almost all future scenarios, six provinces develop new wind generation, with substantial deployment in Alberta (mean 27.3 GW, max. 62.7 GW), Ontario (mean 6.8 GW, max. 19.3 GW), Saskatchewan (mean 3.6 GW, max 8.9 GW) and Manitoba (mean 1.5 GW, max 3.5 GW). With the potential exception of BC, where higher-cost wind generation results in solar generation becoming the primary low-carbon electrical energy source (mean 25.2 GW), future solar generation across Canada is more limited (mean 37.1 GW) and less certain than wind generation in all other Canadian provinces. Existing natural gas generation is maintained in almost all scenarios in all provinces, providing support for maintaining these resources for reliability and reserve requirements. Very limited natural gas is developed under any scenarios, with the exception of British Columbia (mean 4.3 GW) where more than 80 % of scenarios include new natural gas capacity. Additional transmission transfer capacity is developed in most scenarios between BC-Alberta (-60 % of scenarios), SaskatchewanManitoba (-85 %), and Ontario-Quebec (-75 %). Carbon prices, along with wind and solar capital costs, act as primary determinants of least-cost decarbonization pathways. These findings offer insights for Canadian policymakers into net-zero pathways for provincial electricity systems that remain robust despite variability in inputs.

AB The construction industry significantly contributes to global greenhouse gas emissions, highlighting the imperative for developing environmentally friendly construction materials. Geopolymers, particularly those utilizing metakaolin (MK), have emerged as a promising green alternative to conventional concrete. However, the acquisition of MK-based geopolymer concrete with optimal mechanical properties poses challenges due to numerous influential factors, disagreement over various findings, and the lack of a reliable predictive model. This study aimed to address this gap by employing a wide range of machine learning methods, namely gradient boosting machine, random forest, decision tree, artificial neural network, and support vector machine. Different optimization and regularization techniques were used to comprehensively understand the factors affecting the compressive strength of MK-based geopolymer concrete, including mixture design, chemical characteristics of the initial binder and activators, and different curing regimes. The results demonstrated the exceptional performance of the gradient boosting machine in predicting the compressive strength of MK-based geopolymer concrete, achieving a coefficient of determination of 0.983 and a mean absolute error of 1.615 MPa. Additionally, the study employed partial dependence plots, feature importance analysis, and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to elucidate the proposed models. The coarse-to-fine aggregate ratio, H2O/Na2O molar ratio, extra water content, and sodium hydroxide concentration were identified as the most critical parameters affecting the compressive strength of MK-based geopolymer concrete. This research contributes to advancing the development of sustainable construction materials, streamlining experimental tasks, minimizing the need for labor and materials, improving time efficiency, and providing valuable insights for optimizing the design of MKbased geopolymer concrete.

AB Energy generation and pollutant emissions are two faces of the same coin, as the current energy sources i.e., fossil energy, are still considered to be major sources of greenhouse gases (GHG). Therefore, shifting to cleaner energy sources imposes itself as an inevitable solution to reduce this environmental cost. In this paper, a hybrid system based on the multi-agent approach and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to forecast the energy production and its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and simulate the potential emission reduction in case of switching to renewable energy sources is presented. The proposed system's architecture consists of combining LSTM models with the agent-based technology, where multiple LSTM forecasting models were trained to forecast the production of each type of the studied energies and then estimate the equivalent emitted CO2 and calculate the influence of the renewable energy inputs on the carbon emissions and the fossil fuels consumption. The simulation process consists of two phases: firstly, each forecasting agent uses a specific LSTM model to forecast short-term energy production. Secondly, these agents send the forecasted values to the coordination agent who is responsible for calculating the total CO2 emissions and the benefits of the renewable energy inputs.

AB Developing countries, particularly those with high ambient temperatures (HAT), are experiencing a surge in air conditioner (AC) installations. Fixed-speed ACs, which rely on on-off control, are the most used. However, fixed-speed ACs lack humidity control and experience compressor cycling, leading to poor thermal comfort and increased energy consumption. Variable-speed compressor technology eliminates compressor cycling, which increases the effective coefficient of performance, especially at part-load conditions. This study compares the transient performance of variable-speed and fixed-speed AC units in Cairo, Egypt, as an example of a HAT environment. During a 2-month experimental investigation, the variable-speed unit provided 41% electrical energy savings while maintaining a comfortable environment. Analytical modeling using a machine learning model trained by the experimental measurements predicted annual energy savings of 473 kWh/year and an overall electrical energy savings percentage of 30.5%. The study also explored different scenarios for implementing variable-speed ACs in Egypt, a developing HAT country. With a 60% market penetration for variable-speed AC as the most probable scenario, the electrical energy savings up to the year 2032 add to 1.33 TWh, leading to 79.3 million USD in cost savings and 2.64 MMT of CO2 emissions reduction.

AB The modern era has witnessed a surge in energy consumption and its dependence on fossil fuels, which are harmful to the environment, prompting researchers to examine techniques for regulating energy usage in buildings, specifically with regard to residential electricity consumption. The pursuit of net-zero energy consumption and low carbon emission buildings is a significant undertaking that nations across the globe are actively endeavoring to accomplish. In order to accomplish this goal, the structure in question must efficiently oversee its overall energy usage while concurrently capitalizing on sustainable energy sources. The precise estimation of future electricity usage in buildings is an essential element in the process of energy efficiency planning and optimization. The present study introduces a soft computing methodology and data decomposition as approaches for evaluating the energy usage of residential structures. An innovative machine learning approach is introduced for the purpose of estimating the initial cost required to construct a green structure that consumes no net energy. By utilizing wavelet decomposition, it is possible to determine how to transform the structure into one that is intelligent and energy efficient. Following wavelet parallel converter analysis, the data were processed with an estimator model based on an ideal neural network. The results indicate that the mean estimation errors for recurrent neural network, Autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA), and gene expression programming (GEP) were reduced by 72%, 65%, and 77%, respectively, using this method. Conversely, when the proposed methodology is applied to the smart management of building energy consumption, the examined structures experience an average reduction of 8% in energy consumption. Moreover, the outcomes of CO2 gas emissions demonstrate that the suggested model possesses the capability to accurately forecast CO2 emissions. The study highlights the necessity of employing innovative techniques such as machine learning to decrease building energy usage and CO2 emissions. The discovery of these results can assist policymakers and stakeholders in the energy sector in advancing the adoption of smart building technologies.

AB There has been a growing demand for energy consumption statistics in the manufacturing industry to establish national energy and greenhouse gas policies. Despite its importance, the Korean government faces significant challenges in collecting energy data at a facility level in a precise and timely manner. To address the lack of timely data, this paper employs machine-learning models to predict the annual total energy consumptions of each manufacturing facility. We first designed four prediction models that take into account the characteristics and energy consumption behaviors of industry sub-sectors. As input variables, these prediction models mainly included electricity consumption, employee size, energy types, gas consumption and other accessible data. Finally, we conducted numerical experiments on approximately 100,000 facilities and evaluated the prediction performance of various machine-learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, gradient boost regression, and extreme gradient boosting regression. The numerical experiments provided insights into which model and algorithm offer the best prediction performance for each industry sub-sector. In addition, we identified the important variables for predicting total energy consumption, revealing that not only electricity but also various other energy sources and variables representing industry-specific characteristics play a crucial role in improving prediction performance.

AB To cope with rapid urbanization and achieve urban sustainable development, both energy efficiency and GHG emissions in the building sector are considered as the main challenges in recent years. Multi -objective optimization will be a useful tool in energy saving and low carbon for town planning policy making. This study incorporates geographical weighting (GW) with the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), namely the GWLGBM method, to analyze the impact of the surrounding environment on building energy performance. Besides, a genetic algorithm -based approach is applied in this research to achieve a multi -objective optimization solution for buildings' energy performance and GHG emissions. A Pareto front of the optimal trade-off solution with different influential variables and multi -objectives can be determined. Several scenarios incorporating various percentages of constraints are performed, aiming to provide more strategies for decision -makers under different situations. The main findings are summarized as: (1) The proposed GW-LGBM shows superior predictability for assessing the buildings' energy performance than the traditional LGBM. The value of the indices R 2 is 0.91 in site EUWN (weather normalized energy use) and 0.90 in GHG emissions, which have respectively 6.14% and 9.22% improvement compared with the LGBM; (2) Four common factors, including the Natural gas, total Gross floor area, Energy star score, and shape form, are identified as the most important factors for both site EUWN and GHG emissions; (3) The change of the three influence factors, such as the natural gas, vertical to horizontal ratio, and greenery density, is expected to achieve a 37.77% improvement for mitigating energy consumption and GHG emissions given a 10% change in the adjustable factors. The novelty lies in the development of GW-LGBM by adding geographical weight to learning energy patterns for achieving more accurate results in building performance estimation and optimization.

AB China's rising electricity power consumption (EPC) is strongly correlated with carbon emissions. Timely and accurate analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics of EPC is important to the realization of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals in China. However, due to data quality problems and limitations of modeling methods, the estimation accuracy warrants further improvement. In this study, the EPC in China from 2000 to 2020 was estimated based on multisource remote sensing data using the Random Forest (RF) model. Compared with previous studies, the accuracy of this study was improved by 39%-47%. The reasons were combining multisource remote sensing data can mitigate the quality issues of nighttime light (NTL) data, and the RF can capture the nonlinear relations between remote sensing data and EPC. In addition, the spatial pattern of the average EPC in China was dominated by the low-level EPC, as well as showing an obvious increasing trend. We also found that in the middle reaches of the Yellow River and northern coastal China, the low-speed increase in EPC led to high carbon emissions and emission intensity. We suggest optimizing the fuel fix of energy and adjusting the industrial structure, combining them with scientific and rational spatial planning.

TI Potential of artificial intelligence in reducing energy and carbon emissions of commercial buildings at scale
SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Artificial intelligence has emerged as a technology to enhance productivity and improve life quality. However, its role in building energy efficiency and carbon emission reduction has not been systematically studied. This study evaluated artificial intelligence's potential in the building sector, focusing on medium office buildings in the United States. A methodology was developed to assess and quantify potential emissions reductions. Key areas identified were equipment, occupancy influence, control and operation, and design and construction. Six scenarios were used to estimate energy and emissions savings across representative climate zones. Here we show that artificial intelligence could reduce cost premiums, enhancing high energy efficiency and net zero building penetration. Adopting artificial intelligence could reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by approximately 8% to 19% in 2050. Combining with energy policy and low-carbon power generation could approximately reduce energy consumption by 40% and carbon emissions by 90% compared to business-as-usual scenarios in 2050. AI reduces building energy and emissions in design/construction, equipment, occupancy, and control/operation. By accelerating high-efficiency and net-zero buildings, AI could cut energy and emissions by 40-90% by 2050 combined with adequate policies.

AB To improve the energy efficiency of ships and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the implementation of energy-efficient operation measures is particularly important. Driven by this, this study was dedicated to improving the accuracy of ship fuel oil consumption (FOC) prediction and laying the foundation for optimizing energy-efficient operations. Firstly, we combined voyage reports and meteorological data and constructed six datasets containing different features. These features comprise navigation-related features encompassing sailing speed, displacement and trim, as well as meteorological features encompassing wind, wave, sea current, sea water salinity and sea water temperature. Secondly, we conducted experiments with 14 popular ML models on the datasets and compared the prediction performance of different models by a new scoring system. Finally, we explored the advantages and disadvantages of each dataset based on the model performance scoring results and analyzed the effects of related meteorological factors on FOC during navigation. The key findings of the proposed work were that extra trees (ET), random forest (RF), XGBoost, and LightGBM had good fitting and generalization performance. Set5, the dataset containing the most complete meteorological data, achieved the best prediction results. In particular, it had an R2 (test) of 0.9317 on the ET model, which was 1.97% higher than the R2 (test) of the dataset using only voyage reports. The conclusions can assist shipping companies in constructing a ship FOC prediction framework and developing ship fuel-saving strategies.

AB Buildings emit a great deal of carbon dioxide and use a lot of energy. The study of building energy consumption is useful for the sustainable development of multi-energy planning and energy-saving strategies. Therefore, a sustainable development for building energy consumption based on the improved rafflesia optimization algorithm (ROA) with feature selection and ensemble deep learning is proposed in this paper. This method can explore data on building energy usage, assess prediction accuracy, and address concerns that building energy usage research must address. The proposed model first uses an improved self-organizing map with a new neighborhood function to select important features. After that, it uses ensemble deep learning to accurately anticipate the building's energy usage. In addition, the improved ROA is used to fine-tune parameters for feature selection and ensemble deep learning. This research uses the dataset of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) to compare the performance of several modeling approaches. It identifies the top five most important features based on the model's results. Furthermore, the proposed model can be successfully applied to a real-world application. They both have the lowest root mean squared errors among the approaches examined. The proposed model indeed provides the benefits of feature selection and ensemble deep learning with the improved ROA for the prediction of building energy consumption.

AB The current study examines the significant determinants of electricity consumption and identifies an appropriate model to forecast the electricity price accurately. The main contribution is focused on eastern region of Saudi Arabia, a relatively hottest geographical area full of energy resources but with different electricity consumption patterns. The relative irrelevance of temperature as predicting factor of electricity consumption is quite surprising and contradicts the previous studies. In the eastern region, electricity price has negative association with electricity consumption. While comparing traditional and machine learning, it is found that machine learning techniques offer better predictability. Amongst the machine learning techniques, the support vector machine has the lowest errors in forecasting the electricity price. Additionally, the support vector machine approach is used to forecast the trend of carbon emissions caused by electricity consumption.

AB Residential energy consumption is rapidly increasing every year due to demographic and behavioral changes, such as the rising population and the adoption of work-from-home post-COVID-19. High energy consumption emits a substantial amount of carbon dioxide and other Greenhouse Gases, contributing to global warming. It becomes crucial to accurately predict residential load. To enable smart home electricity consumption control, as well as efficient generation, planning, and usage, we predict household energy consumption at very short-term, short-term, and medium-term forecast levels using univariate and multivariate time series data. This study assesses the impact of different household units (water heater and air conditioning), areas (kitchen, laundry, office, living room, bathroom, ironing room, teenager room, and parents' room), and time (i.e., hour, day, and month) on energy consumption. Comparative analysis and numerical experimental results between the most used approaches, Support Vector Regression and Long Short-Term Memory, reveal that the former outperforms the latter across all forecast levels using different datasets. The findings of this paper will be useful to energy companies and household owners in enhancing energy efficiency and earning carbon credits by reducing the emission of carbon dioxide and other Greenhouse Gases.

AB While existing theories investigate the relationship between digital technologies and environmental, social responsibility, and governance (ESG) performance, this study formulates a distinct theoretical framework aimed at understanding of the role played by specific artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies for decarbonization in the manufacturing processes. Drawing upon data sampled from 2607 manufacturing firms listed in Chinese stock markets spanning the years 2004-2020, this study employs an ordinary least squares regression model to investigate the mechanism in question. The findings demonstrate that AI applications facilitate carbon reduction through innovations in terms of production, technology, and management in manufacturing processes, particularly in large-scale enterprises, profitability, and state-owned entities. AI applications integrated into manufacturing processes contribute to ESG performance, especially in terms of environmental (E) considerations and governance (G). This contribution is manifested via improvements in total factor productivity, technological innovation, and information disclosure. Notably, the contributions are more pronounced in less-polluting firms and those located in the underdeveloped western regions of China than in their counterparts. These findings not only enhance the theoretical underpinnings of the ESG framework but also offer practical insights that can serve as a valuable reference for policymakers and governing bodies overseeing manufacturing economies.

AB Energy consumption in buildings contributes to over a third of global energy consumption and 28% of greenhouse gas emissions. With urbanization and population growth, rising building energy demand can lead to environmental degradation. While significant renewable resources are used to generate electricity to mitigate environmental problems, demand-side management remains crucial for achieving net-zero emissions and enhancing energy efficiency. Accurate building load forecasting is pivotal in devising optimal demand response schemes to shift or reduce the demand on power grids. Recent studies have achieved progressive breakthroughs in building energy forecasting through machine learning algorithms. However, most studies focused on building-level energy forecasting rather than individual load forecasting, which cannot support controlled demand response programs. In this study, we propose a multi-task learning model incorporating Patch, Temporal Convolutional Network and Time-Series Transformer (PatchTCN-TST) based on the channel-independent strategy for floor-level multiple electricity loads and indoor environmental forecasting. The PatchTCN-TST model is implemented to predict future data ranging from one-step ahead to three-step ahead on a real-world office building in Bangkok, Thailand. The experiment results indicate that the prediction performance of our model outperforms the prevalent methods, including LSTM, GRU, TCN, Transformer, Informer and Autoformer. The PatchTCN-TST model demonstrates superior accuracy in three forecasting scenarios, significantly reducing MAE, MSE, RMSE, and aSMAPE by 34%, 23%, 12%, and 36.4%, respectively, compared to the best baseline model.

AB The urgent imperative to mitigate carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power generation poses a pressing challenge for contemporary society. In response, there is a critical need to intensify efforts to improve the efficiency of clean energy sources and expand their use, including wind energy. Within this field, it is necessary to address the variability inherent to the wind resource with the application of prediction methodologies that allow production to be managed. At the same time, to extend its use, this clean energy should be made accessible to everyone, including on a small scale, boosting devices that are affordable for individuals, such as Raspberry and other low-cost hardware platforms. This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of various machine learning (ML) algorithms, with special emphasis on deep learning models, in accurately forecasting the power output of wind turbines. Specifically, this research deals with convolutional neural networks (CNN), fully connected networks (FC), gated recurrent unit cells (GRU), and transformer-based models. However, the main objective of this work is to analyze the feasibility of deploying these architectures on various computing platforms, comparing their performance both on conventional computing systems and on other lower-cost alternatives, such as Raspberry Pi 3, in order to make them more accessible for the management of this energy generation. Through training and a rigorous benchmarking process, considering accuracy, real-time performance, and energy consumption, this study identifies the optimal technique to accurately model such real-time series data related to wind energy production, and evaluates the hardware implementation of the studied models. Importantly, our findings demonstrate that effective wind power forecasting can be achieved on low-cost hardware platforms, highlighting the potential for widespread adoption and the personal management of wind power generation, thus representing a fundamental step towards the democratization of clean energy technologies.

AB Buildings are complex assets, characterized by environments and uses that change over time, variable occupancies, and long life cycles. They have high operational costs, mostly due to their energy requirements, and account for 30% to 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, substantial effort has been made to forecast their energy needs, with the scope of optimizing their economic and environmental impact. In this regard, the available literature focuses mainly on short-term modeling through the implementation of sets of physics-based equations (i.e., white-box), functional relationships between input and output variables (i.e., black-box), or a combination of both (i.e., grey-box). On the other hand, more research is required on long-term forecast models with the aim of reducing the energy needs. Within this context, this article presents an original automatic procedure for forecasting the energy needs of buildings in short- and long-term time horizons. This is accomplished by scaling an unknown facility from a similar facility that is already known and by executing a black-box approach based on machine learning algorithms. The proposed method is implemented in real case studies in Italy, predicting the energy needs (i.e., heating, cooling, and electricity) of Sant'Anna Hospital in Ferrara using the historical data of Ca' Foncello Hospital in Treviso. The results show an adjusted coefficient of determination above 0.7 and an average error below 10% for all the energy vectors, demonstrating a feasible forecast performance with a low training set-to-test set ratio.

AB The growing share of renewables, the retirement of coal generation, and the increasing significance (and price) of carbon emissions continue to reshape electricity market dynamics. Ongoing power sector transformations, along with recurrent energy price shocks, bring new challenges to electricity price prediction and projection. Adept at capturing nonlinear and time-varying dynamics of the power market, machine learning (ML) methods can significantly enhance modeling and projection capabilities. This paper leverages ML modeling to (1) analyze the day-ahead electricity price dynamics and (2) develop future price projections under varying market conditions. First, we offer a methodology for identifying and ranking the factors determining day-ahead power price behavior. Guided by the understanding of power price drivers, we then develop an ensemble ML model for highresolution (i.e., for each day of the next year) electricity price projection. Hence, the first part of our analysis helps relate fundamental modeling approaches to ML studies, and the second part extends the existing literature, which is limited to high aggregation level (e.g., yearly basis) projections. High-resolution projections provide valuable insights into within-year price dynamics and help answer highly debated questions raised by the growing share of renewables and the current energy market turmoil. We demonstrate our methodology on the German power market, using data on 80 explanatory variables from 2015 to 2021. We identify the most critical power price drivers and develop an ML model to study the within-year impact of high fuel and carbon prices. Our findings indicate that the often-neglected interaction variables may significantly impact price projections and should be included in day-ahead electricity price modeling. We confirm the efficacy of our approach with a forecasting exercise based on day-ahead electricity prices in the first two quarters of 2022.

AB Urban vehicle emissions are one of the main contributors to air pollution since most vehicles still rely on fossil fuels, despite the growing popularity of alternative options, such as hybrids and electric cars. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation-based controllers have gained attention for their potential use in adaptive traffic signal control. Many studies have been conducted on the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models to reduce travel time in adaptive traffic signal control. However, limited research has been done on adapting traffic signal control to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel consumption in urban vehicles. As such, this work proposes a digital-twin-based adaptive traffic signal control approach that relies on a digital twin (DT) of urban traffic network and uses the DRL multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to optimize for reduced fuel consumption and CO2 emission. The system is designed to simulate different traffic scenarios and control strategies, enabling for adaptation in traffic signal adjustments. To assess the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach, a quantitative simulation is performed using synthetic and real-world traffic data sets from a multi-intersection network in a neighborhood in Amman, Jordan, during peak hours. The findings suggest that the DRL approach based on DTs on synthetic networks can reduce CO2 emissions and fuel consumption even when using a basic reward function based on stopped vehicles.

AB Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies have been steadily adopted and embedded into energy infrastructure following the rapid transformation of energy grids through distributed consumption, renewables generation, and battery storage. The data streams produced by such energy IoT infrastructure can be extracted, processed, analyzed, and synthesized for informed decision-making that delivers optimized grid operations, reduced costs, and net-zero carbon emissions. However, the voluminous nature of such data streams leads to an equally large number of analysis outcomes that have proven ineffective in decision-making by energy grid operators. This gap can be addressed by introducing artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, or more formally conversational agents, to proactively assist human operators in analyzing and identifying decision opportunities in energy grids. In this research, we draw upon the recent success of generative AI for optimized AI chatbots with natural language understanding and generation capabilities for the complex information needs of energy IoT infrastructure and net-zero emissions. The proposed approach for optimized generative AI chatbots is composed of six core modules: Intent Classifier, Knowledge Extractor, Database Retriever, Cached Hierarchical Vector Storage, Secure Prompting, and Conversational Interface with Language Generator. We empirically evaluate the proposed approach and the optimized generative AI chatbot in the real-world setting of an energy IoT infrastructure deployed at a large, multi-campus tertiary education institution. The results of these experiments confirm the contribution of generative AI chatbots in simplifying the complexity of energy IoT infrastructure for optimized grid operations and net-zero carbon emissions.

AB The multifaceted challenge of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions during building operations, construction, and material production perpetuates energy shortages and climate adversities. Urgent imperatives underscore the need for effective energy reduction and carbon mitigation, driving the building sector toward a paradigm shift in clean, low-carbon evolution. However, the complex multidimensional and nonlinear characteristics of influencing factors of building energy consumption make it difficult in precisely understanding the spatial and temporal relationships between the features in the predictive modeling of buildings. Therefore, a novel Graph Wavenet (GWN) based on the spatio-temporal attention fusion mechanism (STA-GWN) is proposed for spatiotemporal graph prediction modeling of structures, which can capture hidden spatial relationships using an adaptive dependency matrix. To overcome the drawbacks of standard predefined adjacency matrices and their inability to capture faraway dependencies, a spatio-temporal attention fusion mechanism is introduced to extract latent spatio-temporal features dynamically. By combining extracted features, building energy consumption can be predicted more precisely. Moreover, the proposed model becomes more interpretable, making it easier to reveal how spatio-temporal features relate to building energy consumption. Lastly, the proposed method is applied to energy conservation and emission reduction in the building industry. A predictive model for electrical energy consumption during two public datasets with an operational phase of buildings is established to analyze and optimize energy utilization in residential structures that rely on electricity. The experimental results demonstrate that the STA-GWN model surpasses other deep learning methods in terms of prediction accuracy and robustness. Moreover, the proposed model can offer optimal solutions for building energy processes, reducing approximately 201.44 kg (Kg) and 64.08 Kg of CO2 emissions in the appliances energy prediction dataset and the individual-household-electric-power-consumption (IHEPC) dataset, respectively.

AB This paper proposes building a sustainable development computing system for large organizations based on AI and IoT. The system leverages AIto calculate the carbon emissions caused by large organizations' activities and utilizes IoT devices to monitor and compute environmental coefficients. The system also employs automated devices to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. By integrating weather forecast information from meteorological agencies to understand external environmental conditions, and by consulting a knowledge database to devise appropriate response strategies, the AI system can activate relevant equipment to improve both the organization's living environment and carbon emission processes. The feasibility and practical application of this system will be demonstrated through actual simulations to enhance its viability and effectiveness.

TI Semantic enrichment for BIM-based building energy performance simulations using semantic textual similarity and fine-tuning multilingual LLM
SO JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING

DE BIM to BEM; BEPS; Semantic enrichment; Semantic textual similarity; Fine tuning LLM
AB To achieve the global targets of the Paris Agreement of limiting global warming, it is necessary to reduce the operational energy of buildings, which are responsible for around 30% of the global greenhouse gas emissions. Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS) is an established method to estimate the building's energy demand in early design stages. Building Information Models (BIM) provides geometric and semantic information to create precise Building Energy Models (BEM) in early design stages. However, manual enrichment of missing semantic information is still a time-consuming and laborious process. Therefore, we propose a novel methodology to automatically enrich missing information to BIM using Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) and fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLM). For every IfcSpace, we match room-specific space types and constructions with missing thermal properties using the semantic most similar pairs of the BIM model and the according databases. We use three real-world case studies to fine-tune LLMs, and two case studies evaluate the whole methodology. Different fine-tuning strategies, such as using different loss functions, adding opposing word pairs or domain-specific abbreviations, significantly improve the accuracy of the matching. At the same time, however, findings show that semantic matching based on multilingual fine-tuned LLM performs worse than translated, monolingually fine-tuned LLM. Finally, BEPS results from automatically enriched BEM only slightly deviate from manually enriched BEM.

AB Simulating anaerobic digestion (AD) using a machine learning (ML) is important for guiding methane production in practice. But the performance of the ML is affected by operational conditions and microbial types and quantities, which lead to low accuracy of the traditional model. In this study, a combined ML algorithm SMOTER-GA-RF was constructed by expanding the number of genomic data, introducing oversampling technique (SMOTER) and genetic algorithm (GA) to increase prediction accuracy, which the test set R-2 increased 36.22%. The normalized root mean square error and percent bias of the validation set (D2) were 8.92% (<10%) and 4.13% (<15%), indicating the accuracy of prediction. Simultaneously, the predictive accuracy of the validation sets (V1-V5) in the presence of Gaussian white noise remained high, confirming the robustness of the SMOTERGA-RF. Furthermore, similar ML models were collected and compared, and it was found that SMOTER-GA-RF constructed in this paper had best effect. Finally, important factors affecting the AD performance of straw were analyzed using SHAP. The hydraulic retention time was controlled at approximately 40 d, volatile fatty acid should be controlled within 1000 mg/L, and the relative abundances of the important archaea Methanoculleus, Methanobacterium and Methanosarcina in the second stage of AD were controlled at 5-10%, <18%, and <5%.

AB Noise interference in gas concentration detection has always been an intractable problem. A novel residual network filter based on deep learning algorithm in this study is proposed to compensate the shortcomings of direct absorption spectroscopy under noisy conditions. Benefiting from the ability of extracting spectral features, the residual network filter established a mapping relationship between the input noisy spectra and the denoised spectra. The signal-to-noise ratio of the residual network filter reached 33.90 dB in the simulation test and its generalization ability was further verified in the experimental test, both of which are superior to widely used filtering algorithms. In the real-time measurement evaluation, the coefficient of determination and standard deviation of the residual network filter-assisted sensor in concentration inversion and stability testing were 0.9999 and 5.82 ppm, respectively. A series of experiments show that this research has high detection accuracy and stability within the full concentration range, which greatly suppresses the noise interference of traditional gas detection. The signal can be effectively extracted even under extremely low signal-to-noise ratio conditions, demonstrating the feasibility of improvement of traditional gas sensors through the proposed deep learning model.

AB Traffic flow modeling has a pivotal role within Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs), holding vital importance in alleviating traffic congestion and decreasing carbon emissions. Due to the presence of variability and nonlinear attributes in traffic flow, developing an effective and resilient model for predicting traffic flow poses a significant challenge. Precisely predicting traffic flow is not merely a feasible issue; it also poses significant difficulties to the researchers involved in this field. This study proposes a hybrid predictive model to forecast traffic flow. The proposed model effectively merges the strengths of the Sparrow Search algorithm (SSA) and Multi-layer Extreme Learning Machine (ML-ELM) model, enhancing prediction accuracy. SSA optimization technique is applied to optimize the initial weights and bias parameters for ML-ELM model. ELM approach is a machine learning approach that employs a single hidden layer to address various tasks. However, in situations where more complex problems are encountered, ML-ELM extends this concept by incorporating multiple hidden layers to enhance its capabilities and address challenges more effectively. Finally, SSA technique is utilized to achieve the optimal tuning of hyperparameters in the context of ML-ELM model to improve the prediction accuracy. Compared to the other selected models, the proposed model outperforms them in terms of performance metrics, including Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE), Mean Absolute Errors (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (MAPE) and Correlation Coefficients (r), indicating that it is appropriate for this prediction task.

AB Under the background of "double carbon", building carbon emission reduction is urgent, and improving energy efficiency through short-term building heat load forecasting is an efficient means of building carbon emission reduction. Aiming at the characteristics of the decomposed short-term building heat load data, such as complex trend changes, significant seasonal changes, and randomness, a single-step short-term building heat load prediction method driven by the multi-component fusion LSTM Ridge Regression Ensemble Model (ST-LSTM-RR) is designed and implemented. First, the trend and seasonal components of the heat load are decomposed by the STL seasonal decomposition algorithm, which are fused into the original data to construct three diversified datasets; second, three basic models, namely, the trend LSTM, the seasonal LSTM, and the original LSTM, are trained; and then, the ridge regression model is trained to fuse the predicted values of the three basic models to obtain the final predicted values. Finally, the method of this paper is applied to the heat load prediction of eight groups in a large mountain hotel park, and the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used as the evaluation indexes. The experimental results show that the average RMSE and average MAE of the prediction results of the proposed method in this paper are minimized on the eight groups.

AB This study incorporates two unique machine learning algorithms, Huber regression and Light Gradient Boosting Machines (LGBM), for estimating ship consumption of fuel. These methods are employed to create forecasting models for ship fuel consumption during journeys, which is especially useful when interacting with non-linear data. The study then analyzes and evaluates the prediction accuracy of these two approaches compared to a baseline model generated using linear regression. The results of the investigation show that both methods establish extremely accurate predictions while handling non-linear data quickly. However, the Huber-based model outperforms the LGBM in terms of prediction accuracy, with an R-squared value of 0.979 versus 0.917 for the LGBM. In addition, the Huber-based model has a diminished prediction error, with an RMSE of 2.278, compared to the LGBM model's RMSE of 4.55. The graphical methods of the violin plot and Taylor's diagram further established the superiority of Huber ML. These findings imply that Huber regression could be a suitable option for estimating in-route ship fuel usage in real time. As a consequence, this study emphasises the potential benefits of machine learning for accurately predicting ship fuel consumption, providing encouraging possibilities to optimise fuel usage while lowering greenhouse gas emissions.

AB A machine learning (ML) model is developed for predicting useable methane (CH4) capacities in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The model applies to a wide variety of MOFs, including those with and without open metal sites, and predicts capacities for multiple pressure swing conditions. Despite its wider applicability, the model requires only 5 measurable structural features as input, yet achieves accuracies that surpass less-general models. Application of the model to a database of more than a million hypothetical MOFs identified several hundred whose capacities surpass that of the benchmark MOF, UMCM-152. Guided by the computational predictions, one of the promising candidates, UMCM-153, was synthesized and demonstrated to achieve superior volumetric capacity for CH4. Feature importance analyses reveal that pore volume and gravimetric surface area are the most important features for predicting CH4 capacity in MOFs. Finally, a reverse ML model is demonstrated. This model predicts the set of elementary MOF structural properties needed to achieve a desired CH4 capacity for a prescribed operating condition.

AB Maintaining energy balance and economical operation is significant for energy hub (EH) which serves as the central component. Implementing real-time regulation for heating and cooling equipment within the EH is challenging due to their slow response time in response to the stochastic fluctuation in renewable energy sources and demands while the opposite is true for electric energy storage equipment (EST), a conventional single timescale energy management strategy is no longer sufficient to take into account the operating characteristics of all equipment. With this motivation, this study proposes a deep reinforcement learning based two-timescale energy management strategy for EH, which controls heating & cooling equipment on a long timescale of 1 h, and EST on a short timescale of 15 min. The actions of the EST are modelled as discrete to reduce the action spaces, and the discrete-continuous hybrid action sequential TD3 model is proposed to address the problem of handling both discrete and continuous actions in long timescale policy. A joint training approach based on the centralized training framework is proposed to learn multiple levels of policies in parallel. The case studies demonstrate that the proposed strategy reduces the economic cost and carbon emissions by 1%, and 0.5% compared to the single time-scale strategy respectively. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning based two-timescale energy management strategy for energy hubs to reduce the economic cost and carbon emissions, with hour-ahead and intra-hour policies that respectively control the heating and cooling equipment at a long timescale, and electrical equipment at a short timescale. image

AB Predicting building energy consumption is important for energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. However, deep learning (DL) models for energy consumption forecasting often have limited predictive generalization and lack explainability. To address these challenges, this research adopts a sequential attention deep learning architecture (SADLA) that uses attention mechanisms to learn the importance of different features for predicting cooling energy consumption, which helps building occupants and managers to make informed decisions about energy optimization. The model was trained and tested on comprehensive and scarce datasets in terms of recording periods and predictor numbers. The data were derived from a three-month field experiment in a commercial office building in Seoul, Korea. Furthermore, models were constructed with other prevalent algorithms like Long Short-Term Memory, deep neural networks, and Extreme Gradient Boosting for comparative assessment. The results from the one- and two-week datasets and reduced features suggested that the SADLA-based models surpassed others in model generalization (R2 = 0.961, 0.967, and 0.976 respectively). However, all algorithms demonstrated comparable performance with the three-month dataset achieving an average R2 of 0.970. These findings underscore the potential of the adopted model in addressing data scarcity in existing and new buildings for accurate cooling energy prediction.

AB The air pollution caused by greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), is a significant environmental concern that impacts air quality and contributes to global warming. The transportation sector plays a pivotal role in this issue, being a major contributor to CO2 emissions. In light of this situation, this article proposes a methodology that utilizes a supervised learning algorithm to estimate CO2 emissions and compare vehicles fueled with ethanol and gasoline. Additionally, the solution adopts an online, unsupervised machine learning algorithm to identify data outliers and improve the confidence in the results. Furthermore, this work incorporates the concept of digital twins, using virtual models of vehicles to carry out more extensive pollution simulations and allowing the simulation of various types of vehicles and the modeling of realistic traffic scenarios. A supervised machine learning approach was adopted to infer emission data in the model, allowing more comprehensive and meaningful comparisons between real-world and simulated measurements. The performed analyses of pollution emissions for different speeds and sections of routes demonstrate that CO2 emissions from ethanol were significantly lower than those from gasoline, favoring more sustainable fuels even in combustion engine vehicles. Adopting cleaner fuels is perceived as crucial to mitigate the negative effects of climate change, with plant-based fuels like ethanol being crucial during the transition from fossil fuels to a more sustainable vehicular landscape.

AB Renewable energy production is one of the most important strategies to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. However, wind and solar energy especially depend on time-varying properties of the environment, such as weather. Hence, for the control and stabilization of electricity grids, the accurate forecasting of energy production from renewable energy sources is essential. This study provides an empirical comparison of the forecasting accuracy of electricity generation from renewable energy sources by different deep learning methods, including five different Transformer-based forecasting models based on weather data. The models are compared with the long short-term memory (LSTM) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models as a baseline. The accuracy of these models is evaluated across diverse forecast periods, and the impact of utilizing selected weather data versus all available data on predictive performance is investigated. Distinct performance patterns emerge among the Transformer-based models, with Autoformer and FEDformer exhibiting suboptimal results for this task, especially when utilizing a comprehensive set of weather parameters. In contrast, the Informer model demonstrates superior predictive capabilities for onshore wind power and photovoltaic (PV) power production. The Informer model consistently performs well in predicting both onshore wind and PV energy. Notably, the LSTM model outperforms all other models across various categories. This research emphasizes the significance of selectively using weather parameters for improved performance compared to employing all parameters and a time reference. We show that the suitability and performance of a prediction model can vary significantly, depending on the specific forecasting task and the data that are provided to the model.

AB Global environmental impacts such as climate change require behavior from society that aims to minimize greenhouse gas emissions. This includes the substitution of fossil fuels with other energy sources. An important aspect of efficient and sustainable management of the electricity supply in Brazil is the prediction of some variables of the national electric system (NES), such as the price of differences settlement (PLD) and wind speed for wind energy. In this context, the present study investigated two distinct forecasting approaches. The first involved the combination of deep artificial neural network techniques, long short-term memory (LSTM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP), optimized through the canonical genetic algorithm (GA). The second approach focused on machine committees including MLP, decision tree, linear regression, and support vector machine (SVM) in one committee, and MLP, LSTM, SVM, and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) in another. The results indicate that the hybrid AG + LSTM algorithm demonstrated the best performance for PLD, with a mean squared error (MSE) of 4.68. For wind speed, there is a MSE of 1.26. These solutions aim to contribute to the Brazilian electricity market's decision making.

AB In today's global society, carbon neutrality has become a focal point of concern. Greenhouse gas emissions and rising atmospheric temperatures are triggering various extreme weather events, sea level rise, and ecological imbalances. These changes not only affect the stability and sustainable development of human society but also pose a serious threat to the Earth's ecosystems and biodiversity. Faced with this global challenge, finding effective solutions has become urgent. This article aims to propose a comprehensive artificial intelligence design approach to address issues related to carbon neutrality. This method integrates technologies from fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and deep learning to achieve a comprehensive understanding of environmental conservation and innovative solutions. Specifically, the authors first use a visual module to extract features from images, which helps capture important information in the images. Next, we employ the ALBEF model for cross -modal alignment, enabling better collaboration between images and textual information.

AB The purpose of this study is to look at how China 's increased use of wind energy and fossil fuel efficiency is affecting the environment. In this direction, novel quantile-based techniques and machine learning algorithmbased approaches are used to examine the effects of real national income, natural resource rent, and trade globalization on carbon emissions, in addition to the technological advancements in wind energy and fossil energy efficiency during the period 2000 -2020. According to the averaged findings, carbon emissions are increased by natural resource rent and economic growth. On the other hand, environmental damage is being lessened by trade globalization, wind energy advances, and fossil energy efficiency. Furthermore, quantile-based results show that in the highest quantiles of environmental degradation, wind energy technology has a far stronger mitigating effect. In a similar vein, improving the efficiency of fossil fuels lowers overall carbon emissions, and this decrease becomes more apparent as carbon emissions rise.

AB This work proposes a new, efficient, economically, and environmentally viable approach for developing cutting-edge energy systems and assisting the anticipated global green transition with maximal renewable integration. The cogeneration of hydrogen and power is driven by biomass, which in turn drives the vanadium chloride cycle and the proton exchange membrane fuel cells. A cooling absorption unit is powered by waste heat recovered using a passive energy improvement technique to improve performance and cut costs. Energy, exergy, exergo-economic, exergo-environmental impacts, and CO2 emission rate of the suggested renewable-based model are analyzed using an engineering equation solver tool. Parametric analysis is also used to assess the impact of key operational factors on main performance indicators. With machine learning, a particle swarm method is implemented in MATLAB to find the optimal operating state with high precision and low computing cost. The results show the importance of multi-objective optimization by pointing out a conflicting change in the performance metrics from different angles by picking up the biomass moisture content and fuel cell current density. According to the optimization results, an acceptable total cost, environmental damage effectiveness, and exergy efficiency of 5 $/h, 0.86, and 55% are achieved through the integration of particle swarm optimizer and artificial neural network method. The results further reveal that the gasification temperature is not sensitive; however, changing the fuel cell utilization factor significantly impacts the system's performance from all sides. Finally, the chord diagram of the irreversibility rate indicates that the fuel cell and gasifier have the highest destruction of 6.4 kW and 2.6 kW under the optimum condition, owing to mixing and chemical re-actions. As for the environmental aspect, by optimizing the system, the system's CO2 emission are greatly reduced.(c) 2023 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study addresses the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions in the power sector, a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, by employing system engineering principles coupled with machine learning techniques. It analyzes the interplay between regional marginal prices (LMP) and carbon emissions within electricity markets. The paper explores how market designs and operational strategies influence carbon output by leveraging a dataset that encompasses hourly LMP and carbon emissions data across various regions of New York State. The analysis utilizes neural networks to simulate and predict the effects of different market scenarios on carbon emissions, highlighting the role of LMP, loss costs, and congestion costs in environmental policy effectiveness. The results underscore the potential of system engineering to provide a holistic framework that integrates market dynamics, policy adjustments, and environmental impacts, thereby offering actionable insights into optimizing market designs for reduced carbon footprints. This approach not only enhances the understanding of the complex interactions within electricity markets but also supports the development of targeted strategies for achieving sustainable energy transitions.

AB Precise energy load forecasting in residential households is crucial for mitigating carbon emissions and enhancing energy efficiency; indeed, accurate forecasting enables utility companies and policymakers, who advocate sustainable energy practices, to optimize resource utilization. Moreover, smart meters provide valuable information by allowing for granular insights into consumption patterns. Building upon available smart meter data, our study aims to cluster consumers into distinct groups according to their energy usage behaviours, effectively capturing a diverse spectrum of consumption patterns. Next, we design JITtrans (Just In Time transformer), a novel transformer deep learning model that significantly improves energy consumption forecasting accuracy, with respect to traditional forecasting methods. Extensive experimental results validate our claims using proprietary smart meter data. Our findings highlight the potential of advanced predictive technologies to revolutionize energy management and advance sustainable power systems: the development of efficient and eco-friendly energy solutions critically depends on such technologies.

AB Energy management is an inspiring domain in developing of renewable energy sources. However, the growth of decentralized energy production is revealing an increased complexity for power grid managers, inferring more quality and reliability to regulate electricity flows and less imbalance between electricity production and demand. The major objective of an energy management system is to achieve optimum energy procurement and utilization throughout the organization, minimize energy costs without affecting production, and minimize environmental effects. Modern energy management is an essential and complex subject because of the excessive consumption in residential buildings, which necessitates energy optimization and increased user comfort. To address the issue of energy management, many researchers have developed various frameworks; while the objective of each framework was to sustain a balance between user comfort and energy consumption, this problem hasn't been fully solved because of how difficult it is to solve it. An inclusive and Intelligent Energy Management System (IEMS) aims to provide overall energy efficiency regarding increased power generation, increase flexibility, increase renewable generation systems, improve energy consumption, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, improve stability, and reduce energy costs. Machine Learning (ML) is an emerging approach that may be beneficial to predict energy efficiency in a better way with the assistance of the Internet of Energy (IoE) network. The IoE network is playing a vital role in the energy sector for collecting effective data and usage, resulting in smart resource management. In this research work, an IEMS is proposed for Smart Cities (SC) using the ML technique to better resolve the energy management problem. The proposed system minimized the energy consumption with its intelligent nature and provided better outcomes than the previous approaches in terms of 92.11% accuracy, and 7.89% miss -rate.

AB Electrification of energy -using terminals is critical for achieving energy transition and climate goals, particularly for polluting and widely used production vehicles. Previous studies extensively discussed the electrification of private vehicles, but few studies focused on the agricultural machinery (AM) which is highly polluting. An analysis of the benefits of electric agricultural machinery (EAM) is essential for effectively promoting the development and dissemination of related technologies. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the carbon emission reduction benefits of EAM. This study analyzed the spatial and temporal characteristics of AM carbon emissions in China from 2000 to 2020 using cluster analysis, and proposed a top -down assessment framework integrating machine learning methods and Bass -diffusion model to quantitatively assess the market penetration and carbon reduction potential of EAM under different scenarios. The results showed that AM cumulative carbon emissions, AM carbon emissions, and AM carbon emissions share coefficients varied significantly among Chinese provinces. The permeability of EAM development varied significantly in different scenarios. The implementation of active planning -type policies will greatly promote the electrification of AM, bringing significant carbon emission reduction benefits compared to the market -driven scenario. The results provide basic information for formulating and promoting EAM-related policies in China.

AB The building sector, known for its high energy consumption, needs to reduce its energy use due to rising greenhouse gas emissions. To attain this goal, a projection for domestic energy usage is needed. This work optimizes short-term load forecasting (STLF) in the building sector while considering several variables (energy consumption/generation, weather information, etc.) that impact energy use. It performs a comparative analysis of various machine learning (ML) models based on different data resolutions and time steps ahead (15 min, 30 min, and 1 h with 4-step-, 2-step-, and 1-step-ahead, respectively) to identify the most accurate prediction method. Performance assessment showed that models like histogram gradient-boosting regression (HGBR), light gradient-boosting machine regression (LGBMR), extra trees regression (ETR), ridge regression (RR), Bayesian ridge regression (BRR), and categorical boosting regression (CBR) outperformed others, each for a specific resolution. Model performance was reported using R2, root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of variation of RMSE (CVRMSE), normalized RMSE (NRMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and execution time. The best overall model performance indicated that the resampled 1 h 1-step-ahead prediction was more accurate than the 15 min 4-step-ahead and the 30 min 2-step-ahead predictions. Findings reveal that data preparation is vital for the accuracy of prediction models and should be model-adjusted.

AB Bangladesh's surging power demand, especially in coastal regions and nearby islands, necessitates a shift towards sustainable energy sources to meet Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG-7) objectives. This research attempts to visualize the ocean thermal energy reserves of the Bay of Bengal, with an extended focus on the marine borders of Bangladesh using advanced data analytics. Extensive data used is from a hybrid ocean coordinate model, Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model and Navy Coupled Ocean Data Assimilation (HYCOM + NCODA) at 1/12 degrees resolution, which has proven to be sophisticated and precise in providing oceanic information. Analyzing the data shows that geographically Bangladesh is feasible for Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) plants. A model plant is implemented at the potential location, and a Machine Learning (ML) model is trained to forecast temperature values for the future lifetime of the plant. ML forecasted results show the annual average power generated varies between 103.8 and 105.8 MW throughout the plant's life. However, a slight downward trend in generated power is observed, possibly due to climate change. The Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) is calculated at 0.164 USD/ kW, with an 11-year payback period. Notably, the plant registers zero Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, aligning with Bangladesh's SDG-13 targets.

TI A Mixed Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning Based Vehicle Path Planning Algorithm

AB Vehicle path planning is one of the effective ways to relieve the huge traffic flow pressure of modern urban transportation system, and it is also an important way to realize carbon emission reduction and to build green transportation system as well as smart city. At present, the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms with reinforcement learning (RL) as the mainstream have achieved great success in the field of vehicle path planning. However, RL only conducts policy learning based on the evaluation feedback of the environment, whereas imitation learning (IL) can obtain more direct feedback from expert decision data, and then obtain a decision model close to the expert level by comparing with RL. At present, there are very few vehicle path planning algorithms based on IL, and they are often hindered by the compounding error and sample complexity dilemma, resulting in poor path planning effectiveness. In order to overcome these problems, in this paper, a mixed generative adversarial IL (MixGAIL) algorithm has been proposed, which effectively integrates the transition aware adversarial IL (TAIL) and generative adversarial IL (GAIL) based on minimum-distance functions (MIMIC-MD) methods under the framework of GAIL. In order to overcome the optimization dilemma of non-convex and non-smooth objective function after the integration, the proposed MixGAIL uses mixed policy gradient actor-critic model with random escape term and filter optimization (MPGACEF), and pioneers the noise projected subgradient descent method with momentum (MNPSGD) for global optimization. Experiments have shown that by learning expert decision data, MixGAIL has better vehicle path planning performance and faster iteration speed than classic IL algorithms such as behavioral cloning (BC), dataset aggregation (DAgger), feature expectation matching (FEM), game theoretical appraisal learning (GTAL), TAIL, and MIMIC-MD, and is closer to expert level.

AB As the mining sector strives to meet its greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets by 2030 and 2050, the need for efficient energy-saving measures becomes paramount. This study presents an improved smart dispatching solution developed using deep reinforcement learning to improve the performance of mining haul truck fleets. The proposed solution based on double deep Q-network (DDQN) trains each truck in the fleet to make real-time decisions based on various factors such as in-situ grade (ore or waste), road traffic, estimated queueing, and maintenance requirements. Scenarios based on a synthetic mine are simulated to evaluate the effectiveness of this DDQN-based artificial intelligence solution versus conventional approaches. Our results demonstrate that the proposed DDQN solution not only improves productivity and reduces fuel-related GHG emissions, but also significantly improves fleet performance in handling operational disruptions (production loss reduced by over 50%) without human intervention, including unexpected changes in fleet size and shovel grade. The cost-effectiveness and scalability of the proposed solution are also assessed. Comparative analysis revealed that upgrading the fleet with the proposed DDQN solution to reduce GHG emissions only equates, on average, 47% and 21% of fleet electrification and carbon capture and storage costs, respectively, and can be rapidly adopted in the near term. These advantages position the smart fleet dispatching system as a cost-effective approach to enhance productivity and reduce direct GHG emissions in mining operations for short-term targets, making it an adaptive technology for future automated and sustainable mining.

AB An accurate, timely and large-scale yield prediction is considered critically important to frame policies to mitigate climate change risks and for ensured food security. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), being a major cereal grain crop of north-western India, has been highly energy intensive with large emissions of greenhouse gases, affecting ecosystems' sustainability. We therefore, performed energy optimization in wheat for enhanced ecosystems' resilience and carbon (C) sustainability, while predicting yields of 120 intensive wheat production systems across north-western India. An integrated approach of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and machine learning (ML) models was applied for energy optimization and accurate yield prediction. After optimization of energy input in wheat production, 8 different ML models of variable complexity viz. linear regression (LR), ridge regression (RR), lasso regression (LAR), elastic net regression (ENR), decision tree regression (DT), random forest regression (RF), gradient boosting regression (GB) and support vector regression (SVR) were applied and evaluated statistically for accurate prediction of wheat yields of studied decision making units (DMUs). These results revealed that wheat ecosystems have a high total input energy (E-I) of 24.7 GJ ha(-1), which comprises similar to 46.5% share of direct and 53.5% of indirect energy sources. The non-renewable energy input was similar to 3.9 times higher than the renewable energy. The total C equivalent emissions of 1815.7 kg CO2e ha(-1) comprised the highest share of chemical fertilizers (similar to 49.8%), and exhibited a linear significant relationship with E-I (R-2 = 0.8117**; p < 0.01). Nitrogenous fertilizers application contributes similar to 90.1% towards total fertilizer related energy input in wheat production. The net global warming potential of 2.30 Mg CO2e ha(-1) yr(-1) was estimated which resulted in yield scaled emissions (i.e., greenhouse gases intensity) of 0.34 kg CO2e kg(-1) wheat grain yield. The DEA-based benchmarking showed that the technical efficiency (TE) score of 79 DMUs was < 1.00, elucidated similar to 65% DMUs as energy inefficient. The average (n = 120) TE score of 0.92 illustrates energy saving possibility of 2464.6 MJ ha(-1) (similar to 8% of E-I), mostly via efficient fertilizer (54.4%) and irrigation water management (11.6%). The 1:1 (x = y) correspondence analysis implies that DT, GB, and RF models can accurately predict wheat productivity with significantly higher R-2 values of 0.998** (p < 0.01), 0.950** (p < 0.01), and 0.832* (p < 0.05), respectively. These results underpin overwhelming significance of DEA-based energy optimization for wheat ecosystems, which helps reduce the energy and C footprints for sustainable and cleaner production. Nonetheless, DT, GB, and RF models outperformed in yield prediction with the lowest root mean square error and normalized mean square error, but the highest Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and index of agreement. Therefore, DEA-based benchmarking has significant energy saving potential, while DT, GB, and RF models have highly accurate wheat yield prediction abilities for north-western India.

AB A global effort has been initiated to reduce the worldwide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, primarily carbon emissions, by half by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050. The development of 6G must also be compliant with this goal. Unfortunately, developing a sustainable and net-zero emission systems to meet the users' fast growing demands on mobile services, especially smart services and applications, may be much more challenging than expected. Particularly, despite the energy efficiency improvement in both hardware and software designs, the overall energy consumption and carbon emission of mobile networks are still increasing at a tremendous speed. The growing penetration of resource-demanding Al algorithms and solutions further exacerbate this challenge. In this article, we identify the major emission sources and introduce an evaluation framework for analyzing the lifecycle of network Al implementations. A novel joint dynamic energy trading and task allocation optimization framework, called DETA, has been introduced to reduce the overall carbon emissions. We consider a federated edge intelligence-based network Al system as a case study to verify the effectiveness of our proposed solution. Experimental results based on a hardware prototype suggest that our proposed solution can reduce carbon emissions of network Al systems by up to 74.9 percent. Finally, open problems and future directions are discussed.
