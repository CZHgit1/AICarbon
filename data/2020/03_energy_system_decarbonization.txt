AB Buildings must be energy efficient and sustainable because buildings have contributed significantly to world energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission. Predicting energy consumption patterns in buildings is beneficial to utility companies, users, and facility managers because it can help to improve energy efficiency. This work proposed a Random Forests (RF) - based prediction model to predict the short-term energy consumption in the hourly resolution in multiple buildings. Five one-year datasets of hourly building energy consumption were used to examine the effectiveness of the RF model throughout the training and test phases. The evaluation results presented that the RF model exhibited a good prediction accuracy in the prediction. In four evaluation scenarios, the mean absolute error (MAE) values ranged from 0.430 to 0.501 kWh for the 1-step-ahead prediction, from 0.612 to 0.940 kWh for the 12-steps-ahead prediction, and from 0.626 to 0.868 kWh for the 24-steps-ahead prediction. The RF model was superior to the M5P and Random Tree (RT) models. The RF was better about 49.21%, 46.93% in the MAE and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) than the RT model in forecasting 1-step-ahead building energy consumption. The RF model approved the outstanding performance with the improvement of 49.95% and 29.29% in MAE compared to the M5P model in the 12-steps-ahead, and 24-steps-ahead energy use, respectively. Thus, the proposed RF model was an effective prediction model among the investigated machine learning (ML) models. This study contributes to (i) the state of the knowledge by examining the generalization and effectiveness of ML models in predicting building energy consumption patterns; and (ii) the state of practice by proposing an effective tool to help the building owners and facility managers in understanding building energy performance for enhancing the energy efficiency in buildings.

AB Decarbonization of marine transport is a key global issue, with the carbon emissions of international shipping projected to increase 23% to 1090 million tonnes by 2035 in comparison to 2015 levels. Optimization of the energy system (especially propulsion system) in these vessels is a complex multi-objective challenge involving economical maintenance, environmental metrics, and energy demand requirements. In this paper, data from instrumented vessels on the River Thames in London, which includes environmental emissions, power demands, journey patterns, and variance in operational patterns from the captain(s) and loading (passenger numbers), is integrated and analyzed through automatic, multi-objective global optimization to create an optimal hybrid propulsion configuration for a hybrid vessel. We propose and analyze a number of computational techniques, both for monitoring and remaining useful lifetime (RUL) estimation of individual energy assets, as well as modeling and optimization of energy use scenarios of a hybrid-powered vessel. Our multi-objective optimization relates to emissions, asset health, and power performance. We show that, irrespective of the battery packs used, our Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) algorithm is able to achieve over 92% accuracy in remaining useful life (RUL) predictions. A k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) is proposed for prognostics of state of charge (SOC) of back-up lead-acid batteries. The classifier achieved an average of 95.5% accuracy in a three-fold cross validation. Utilizing operational data from the vessel, optimal autonomous propulsion strategies are modeled combining the use of battery and diesel engines. The experiment results show that 70% to 80% of fuel saving can be achieved when the diesel engine is operated up to 350 kW. Our methodology has demonstrated the feasibility of combination of artificial intelligence (AI) methods and real world data in decarbonization and optimization of green technologies for maritime propulsion.

AB Non-domestic buildings contribute 20% of the UK's annual carbon emissions. A contribution exacerbated by its ageing stock of which only 7% is considered new-build. Consequently, the government has set regulations to decrease the amount of energy take-up by buildings which currently favour deep energy retrofitting analysis for decision-making and demonstrating compliance. Due to the size and complexity of non-domestic buildings, identifying optimal retrofit packages can be very challenging. The need for effective decision-making has led to the wide adoption of artificial intelligence in the retrofit strategy design process. However, the vast retrofit solution space and high time-complexity of energy simulations inhibit artificial intelligence's application. This paper presents an energy performance prediction model for non-domestic buildings supported by machine learning. The aim of the model is to provide a rapid energy performance estimation engine for assisting multiobjective optimisation of non-domestic buildings energy retrofit planning. The study lays out the process of model development from the investigation of requirements and feature extraction to the application on a case study. It employs sensitivity analysis methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the feature set in covering retrofit technologies. The machine learning model which is optimised using advanced evolutionary algorithms provide a robust and reliable tool for building analysts enabling them to meaningfully explore the expanding solution space. The model is evaluated by assessing three thousand retrofit variations of a case study building, achieving a root mean square error of 1.02 kgCO(2)/m(2) x year equal to 1.7% of error.

AB Machine learning has emerges as a novel method for model development and has potential to be used to predict and control the performance of anaerobic digesters. In this study, several machine learning algorithms were applied in regression and classification models on digestion performance to identify determinant operational parameters and predict methane production. In the regression models, k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm demonstrates optimal prediction accuracy (root mean square error = 26.6, with the dataset range of 259.0-573.8), after narrowing prediction coverage by excluding extreme outliers from the validation set. In the classification models, logistic regression multiclass algorithm yields the best prediction accuracy of 0.73. Feature importance reveals that total carbon was the determinant operational parameter. These results demonstrate the great potential of using machine learning algorithms to predict anaerobic digestion performance.

AB Wind power plays a key role in reducing global carbon emission. The power curve provided by wind turbine manufacturers offers an effective way of presenting the global performance of wind turbines. However, due to the complicated dynamics nature of offshore wind turbines, and the harsh environment in which they are operating, wind power forecasting is challenging, but at the same time vital to enable condition monitoring (CM). Wind turbine power prediction, using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data, may not lead to the optimum control strategy as sensors may generate non-calibrated data due to degradation. To mitigate the adverse effects of outliers from SCADA data on wind power forecasting, this paper proposed a novel approach to perform power prediction using high-frequency SCADA data, based on isolate forest (IF) and deep learning neural networks. In the predictive model, wind speed, nacelle orientation, yaw error, blade pitch angle, and ambient temperature were considered as input features, while wind power is evaluated as the output feature. The deep learning model has been trained, tested, and validated against SCADA measurements. Compared against the conventional predictive model used for outlier detection, i.e. based on Gaussian Process (GP), the proposed integrated approach, which coupled IF and deep learning, is expected to be a more efficient tool for anomaly detection in wind power prediction.

AB Annually, 48% of the global energy is used by buildings in their construction, operation, and maintenance, causing significant damage to the environment due to the resulting greenhouse gas emissions. During their life cycles, buildings use energy in the form of embodied energy (EE) and operating energy (OE). In a conventional building, EE accounts for 10-20% of a building's life cycle energy (LCE), while OE accounts for 80-90%. As a result, the building sector has taken several measures to reduce OE in buildings. These OE reducing measures fail to account for the subsequent increase in EE and might cause an increase in the building's overall LCE. A systematic review of the literature shows limited research that comprehensively evaluates the impact of design measures aimed at OE reduction on EE for different construction assemblies. In this study, we quantify and compare trade-offs on EE demand, caused by OE reduction measures for eight different building wall assemblies across four climatic zones within the United States. The EE and OE demands of the ASHRAE 90.1-2016 benchmark model and its variations were computed using Tally (TM) and Autodesk (R) Green Building Studio (R) (GBS), respectively. The results helped us determine the EE factor (EE spent per unit of OE savings) for different OE reduction measures. Although the calculated EE factors vary across different climatic zones and construction assemblies, these factors show significant EE costs for different OE reduction measures. This knowledge could help inform the design of evolutionary and deep/machine learning-based algorithms to assess and optimize building energy use. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study is to apply machine learning models to accurately predict daily biomethane production in an industrial-scale co-digestion facility. The methodology involved applying elasticnet, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting to input-output data from an industrial-scale anaerobic co-digestion (ACoD) facility. The models were used to predict biomethane for 1-day, 3-day, 5-day, 10-day, 20-day, 30-day, and 40-day time horizons. These models were fit on four years of operational data. The results showed that elastic net (a model with assumptions of linearity) was clearly outperformed by random forest and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), which had out-of-sample R-2 values ranging between 0.80 and 0.88, depending on the time horizon. In addition, feature importance and partial dependence analysis demonstrated the marginal and interaction effects on biomethane of selected biowaste inputs. For instance, food waste co-digested with percolate were shown to have strong positive interaction effects. One implication of this study is that XGBoost and random forest algorithms applied to industrial-scale ACoD data provide dependable prediction results and may be a useful complement for experimental and mechanistic/theoretical models of anaerobic digestion, especially where detailed substrate characterization is difficult. However, these models have limitations, and suggestions for deriving additional value from these methods are proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In 2018, commercial buildings accounted for nearly 18.2% of the total energy consumption in the USA, making it a significant contributor to the greenhouse gases emissions (see, e.g. [1]). Specifically, office buildings accounted for 14% of the energy usage by the commercial sector. Hence, their energy performance has to be closely monitored and evaluated to address the critical issues of greenhouse gases emissions. Several data-driven statistical and machine learning models have been developed to assess the energy performance of office buildings based on historical data. While these methods often provide reliable prediction accuracy, they typically offer little interpretation of the relationships between variables and their impacts on energy consumption. Moreover, model interpretability is essential to understand, control and manage the variables affecting the energy consumption and therefore, such a feature is crucial and should be emphasized in the modeling procedure in order to obtain reliable and actionable results. For this reason, we use generalized additive models as a flexible, efficient and interpretable alternative to existing approaches in modeling and predicting the energy consumption in office buildings. To demonstrate the advantages of this approach, we consider an application to energy consumption data of HVAC systems in a mixed-use multi-tenant office building in Chicago, Illinois, USA. We present the building characteristics and various influential variables, based on which we construct a generalized additive model. We compare the prediction performance using various commonly used calibration metrics between the proposed model and existing methods, including support vector machine as well as classification and regression tree. We find that the proposed method outperforms the existing approaches, especially in terms of short term prediction. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The sustainable development of mankind is a matter of concern to the whole world. Environmental pollution and haze diffusion have greatly affected the sustainable development of mankind. According to previous research, vehicle exhaust emissions are an important source of environmental pollution and haze diffusion. The sharp increase in the number of cars has also made the supply of energy increasingly tight. In this paper, we have explored the use of intelligent navigation technology based on data analysis to reduce the overall carbon emissions of vehicles on road networks. We have implemented a traffic flow prediction method using a genetic algorithm and particle-swarm-optimization-enhanced support vector regression, constructed a model for predicting vehicle exhaust emissions based on predicted road conditions and vehicle fuel consumption, and built our low-carbon-emission-oriented navigation algorithm based on a spatially optimized dynamic path planning algorithm. The results show that our method could help to significantly reduce the overall carbon emissions of vehicles on the road network, which means that our method could contribute to the construction of low-carbon-emission intelligent transportation systems and smart cities.

AB Hybrid energy storage systems (HESS) involve synergies between multiple energy storage technologies with complementary operating features aimed at enhancing the reliability of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES). Nevertheless, coordinating HESS through optimized energy management strategies (EMS) introduces complexity. The latter has been previously addressed by the authors through a systems-level graphical EMS via Power Pinch Analysis (PoPA). Although of proven efficiency, accounting for uncertainty with PoPA has been an issue, due to the assumption of a perfect day ahead (DA) generation and load profiles forecast. This paper proposes three adaptive PoPA-based EMS, aimed at negating load demand and RES stochastic variability. Each method has its own merits such as; reduced computational complexity and improved accuracy depending on the probability density function of uncertainty. The first and simplest adaptive scheme is based on a receding horizon model predictive control framework. The second employs a Kalman filter, whereas the third is based on a machine learning algorithm. The three methods are assessed on a real isolated HESS microgrid built in Greece. In validating the proposed methods against the DA PoPA, the proposed methods all performed better with regards to violation of the energy storage operating constraints and plummeting carbon emission footprint.

AB Buildings are one of the significant sources of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission in urban areas all over the world. Lighting control and building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) are two effective measures in reducing overall primary energy consumption and carbon emission during building operation. Due to the complex energy nature of the building, accurate day-ahead prediction of heating, cooling, lighting loads and BIPV electrical power production is essential in building energy management. Owing to the changing metrological conditions, diversity and complexity of buildings, building energy load demands and BIPV electrical power production is highly variable. This may lead to poor building energy management, extra primary energy consumption or thermal discomfort. In this study, three machine learning-based multi-objective prediction frameworks are proposed for simultaneous prediction of multiple energy loads. The three machine learning techniques are artificial neural network, support vector regression and long-short-term-memory neural network. Since heating, cooling, lighting loads and BIPV electrical power production share similar affecting factors, it is computational time saving to adopt the proposed multi-objective prediction framework to predict multiple building energy loads and BIPV power production. The ANN-based predictive model results in the smallest mean absolute percentage error while SVM-based one cost the shortest computation time.

AB To alleviate the overloads in the power system and to reduce the exponential growth in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, deployment of the renewable energy sources (RES) into the power system is the need of the hour. However, injecting these RES into the current power system network causes large voltage and power overshoots hence deteriorate the transient response and power quality of the overall power system. In this paper, an efficient solution of the above-mentioned issues is explored by developing an optimal microgrid (MG) controller using one of the most modern and intelligent artificial intelligence (AI) techniques named the salp swarm optimization algorithm (SSA). The intelligence of the SSA is exploited to select the optimal controller gains and dc-link capacitance value by minimizing a time integrating error fitness function (FF) which in-turn enhances the dynamic response and power quality of the studied MG system. The proposed grid-tied MG controller is designed to achieve the preset active and reactive power sharing ratio between distributed generator (DG) and utility grid during DG and load switching conditions. To validate the superiority of the proposed controller, its performance is compared with that of its precedent grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA)-based controller for the identical operating conditions and system configuration. The outcomes of the study show that the proposed MG controller outperforms its competitor in terms of transient response and quality of power.

AB We propose a method for detecting and forecasting events of high energy demand, which are managed at the national level in demand side response programmes, such as the UK Triads. The methodology consists of two stages: load forecasting with long short-term memory neural network and dynamic filtering of the potential highest electricity demand peaks by using the exponential moving average. The methodology is validated on real data of a UK building management system case study. We demonstrate successful forecasts of Triad events withRRMSE approximate to 2.2%andMAPE approximate to 1.6%and general applicability of the methodology for demand side response programme management, with reduction of energy consumption and indirect carbon emissions.

AB Multiple nations have implemented policies for greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction since the 21st Conference of Parties (COP 21) at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2015. In this convention, participants voluntarily agreed to a new climate regime that aimed to decrease GHG emissions. Subsequently, a reduction in GHG emissions with specific reduction technologies (renewable energy) to decrease energy consumption has become a necessity and not a choice. With the launch of the Korean Emissions Trading Scheme (K-ETS) in 2015, Korea has certified and financed GHG reduction projects to decrease emissions. To help the user make informed decisions for economic and environmental benefits from the use of renewable energy, an assessment model was developed. This study establishes a simple assessment method (SAM), an assessment database (DB) of 1199 GHG reduction technologies implemented in Korea, and a machine learning-based GHG reduction technology assessment model (GRTM). Additionally, we make suggestions on how to evaluate economic benefits, which can be obtained in conjunction with the environmental benefits of GHG reduction technology. Finally, we validate the applicability of the assessment model on a public building in Korea.

AB Energy consumption for space heating and cooling typically accounts for more than 40% of residential household energy consumption. An accurate and fast prediction of space heating and cooling loads aids energy conservation and carbon emission reduction by relieving the simulation burden for optimisation design, which consider various building characteristics combinations. This study aims to develop machine learning based load prediction model for residential building, five machine-learning models have been utilised for the prediction of residential building space heating and cooling load intensities, with occupant behaviour innovatively accounted as predictor variable. Their prediction performances are compared with each other. The five machine-learning models used in this study are linear kernel support vector regression, polynomial kernel support vector regression, Gaussian radial basis function kernel support vector regression, linear regression, and artificial neural networks. The results indicate that the Gaussian radial basis function kernel support vector regression is the best-performing model, with training time of less than 35s as well as less than 4% normalised mean absolute error and normalised root-mean-square error for both cooling and heating load prediction. The sample size of training and validation set for Gaussian radial basis function kernel support vector regression model is suggested as 200 samples. A data-driven machine-learning-based prediction model is an alternative to complex simulation tools in aiding the decision making of both building design and retrofit processes.

AB Shale gas contributes significantly to current global energy consumption, and an accurate estimation of geological gas-in-place (GIP) determines an optimal production plan. As the dominant form of storage, adsorbed gas in shale formation is of primary importance to be assessed. This paper summarizes adsorption models into traditional pressure/density dependent isothermal models, pressure and temperature unified model, and machine learning based models. Using a comprehensive experimental dataset, these models are applied to simulate shale gas adsorption under in-situ conditions. Results show that the modified Dubinin-Radushkevich (DR) model provides the optimal performance in traditional isothermal models. Pressure and temperature unified models make a breakthrough in isothermal conditions and can extrapolate the predictions beyond test ranges of temperature. Well-trained machine learning models not only break the limit of the isothermal condition and types of shale formation, but can also provide reasonable extrapolations beyond test ranges of temperature, total organic carbon (TOC), and moisture. Four popular machine learning algorithms are used, which include artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). The XGBoost model is found to provide the best results for predicting shale gas adsorption, and it can be conveniently updated for broader applications with more available data. Overall, this paper demonstrates the capability of machine learning for prediction of shale gas adsorption, and the well-trained model can potentially be built into a large numerical frame to optimize production curves of shale gas.

AB This paper describes a framework for estimating the effectiveness of photovoltaic and rainwater harvesting technology deployment on industrial and commercial zoned buildings to facilitate reducing national GHG emissions. Decarbonisation technologies pathways were investigated which may aid in meeting national decarbonisation targets, and their potential role at local administrative area scale evaluated. A finding arising from application of this method was that a small number of larger industrial and commercial buildings, representing only 4% of the sectors buildings, were found to account for 38% of its decarbonisation potential. Future carbon emission scenarios identified that electricity demand may be expected to increase for the industrial and commercial sector up to 2030, and that the technological potential for current photovoltaics systems have the potential to reduce GHG emissions by 4% more than currently planned Irish grid-scale decarbonisation trajectories. The method may be adopted at European scale, using local data on climate and building attributes, and is applicable at national, regional and local scales. The paper concludes with a review of technologies which may aid further decarbonisation studies, which include improved data availability for 3D building generation, and enabling technologies such as machine learning algorithms applied to satellite imagery.

AB To minimize the anticipated shocks to economic, environmental, and social systems for developing and least developed countries, the reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions is mandatory to a large extend. The nuclear-renewable integrated system is proficient in optimal energy distribution to multiple production schemes to reduce GHG emissions and maximize profit. This paper addresses the hybridization of the micronuclear reactor and Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) Energy Sources (RESs) to develop a flexible, cost-effective, sustainable, and resilient off-grid Hybrid Energy System (HES). The paper presents three types of hybridization methods, termed "Direct Coupling," "Single Resource and Multiple products-based Coupling," and "Multiple Resources and Multiple products-based Coupling." The hybridization techniques are used to plan and identify the most efficient Nuclear-Renewable Micro-Hybrid Energy System (N-R MHES). The sizing, performance, and characterization of N-R MHES solely depend on the RES and load characteristics' availability. Based on proposed hybridization techniques, mathematical modeling of N-R MHES's economy is carried out in the MATLAB environment. An artificial intelligence optimization algorithm, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), is used to minimize the Net Present Cost (NPC) and achieve the optimal system configurations of different N-R MHESs. The simulation results determine that "Multiple Resources and Multiple Products-based N-R MHES" provides around 1.8 times and 1.3 times lower NPC than "Single Resource and Multiple products-based Coupling" and "Multiple Resources and Multiple products-based Coupling," respectively, with an acceptable margin of reliability. A sensitivity analysis has also been conducted in this paper to strengthen the findings of the study.

AB The demand for highly efficient power generation systems is ever escalating to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This study proposes a novel quadruple power generation system, investigates its performance characteristics, and optimizes its efficiency using an artificial intelligence method based on the results of a thermodynamic simulation. The quadruple system integrates four power blocks consisting of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC), a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC), a gas turbine, and an organic Rankine cycle to achieve high efficiency. A parametric analysis of the main design parameters was conducted. An artificial intelligence method combining an artificial neural network and a genetic algorithm was devised to avoid the slow speed of the calculation for the thermodynamically optimal solution and used to find the optimized design parameters that produce the maximum efficiency. The results of the thermodynamic parametric analysis were used to train the artificial neural network. The results of the optimization method were verified through comparison with the results of thermodynamic analysis. A very high maximum efficiency of 78.1% was predicted. The performance of the optimized quadruple system was examined by comparing it with that of other hybrid power systems.

AB Facility Layout Design (FLP) is an NP-Hard, which is related to the optimization of the arrangement of facilities in a shop floor or manufacturing unit to maximize the performance and minimize the operating cost. An efficient layout must not only consider the profit but also emphasize on other social causes such as energy consumption, pollution, and people's safety. These are referred to as the three pillars of sustainability. This paper identifies the criteria for sustainability in a manufacturing layout and presents an aggregate mathematical formulation for Sustainable Facility Layout Problem (SFLP). The paper proposes a novel 4-stage methodology using Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Hybrid Meta-heuristic, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), and K-mean clustering for designing an energy-efficient sustainable sub-optimal layout under uncertain (stochastic) demand over multiple periods. The goal of this framework is to 1) uniquely rank and predict an efficient SFLP that overcomes the dimensionality curse associated with handling large data set, 2) use K-mean to identify the criteria that maximally satisfied an efficient sustainable layout and propose an SFLP model that can be customized depending social, political and economic conditions, and 3) evaluate the total energy consumption and CO2 emission for an efficient sustainable facility layout. To show the running methodology a case is presented using hypothetical data from the literature.

AB In view of the increasing development of decentralized power systems and electric vehicles, this paper seeks to improve the energy management performance of multiple microgrid systems under the uncertainty associated with electric vehicle charging. A multi-objective optimization model is established for minimizing the transmission losses, operating costs, and carbon emissions of multiple microgrid systems. Firstly, a novel method is proposed for forecasting electric vehicle charging loads based on a back propagation neural network improved by long short-term memory deep learning. Based on the forecast data, a double layer solution algorithm is proposed, which consists of an adaptive multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition and differential evolution at the multiple microgrids layer and a modified consistency algorithm for fast economic scheduling at the single microgrid layer. Finally, a model system composed of four interconnected IEEE microgrids is simulated as a case study, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with that of conventional multi-objective evolutionary algorithms based on decomposition. The simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the global search performance and the rapid convergence performance of the proposed improved algorithm. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Using Deep Learning to Forecast Maritime Vessel Flows

AB Forecasting vessel flows is important to the development of intelligent transportation systems in the maritime field, as real-time and accurate traffic information has favorable potential in helping a maritime authority to alleviate congestion, mitigate emission of GHG (greenhouse gases) and enhance public safety, as well as assisting individual vessel users to plan better routes and reduce additional costs due to delays. In this paper, we propose three deep learning-based solutions to forecast the inflow and outflow of vessels within a given region, including a convolutional neural network (CNN), a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and the integration of a bidirectional LSTM network with a CNN (BDLSTM-CNN). To apply those solutions, we first divide the given maritime region into M x N grids, then we forecast the inflow and outflow for all the grids. Experimental results based on the real AIS (Automatic Identification System) data of marine vessels in Singapore demonstrate that the three deep learning-based solutions significantly outperform the conventional method in terms of mean absolute error and root mean square error, with the performance of the BDLSTM-CNN-based hybrid solution being the best.

AB One of the main challenges in urban development faced by large cities is related to traffic jam. Despite increasing effort s to maximize the vehicle flow in large cities, to provide greater accuracy to estimate the traffic jam and to maximize the flow of vehicles in the transport infrastructure, without increasing the overhead of information on the control-related network, still consist in issues to be investigated. Therefore, using artificial intelligence method, we propose a solution of inter-vehicle communication for estimating the congestion level to maximize the vehicle traffic flow in the transport system, called TRAFFIC. For this, we modeled an ensemble of classifiers to estimate the congestion level using TRAFFIC. Hence, the ensemble classification is used as an input to the proposed dissemination mechanism, through which information is propagated between the vehicles. By comparing TRAFFIC with other studies in the literature, our solution has advanced the state of the art with new contributions as follows: (i) increase in the success rate for estimating the traffic congestion level; (ii) reduction in travel time, fuel consumption and CO2 emission of the vehicle; and (iii) high coverage rate with higher propagation of the message, maintaining a low packet transmission rate.

AB In order to combat climate change, many countries have promised to bolster Renewable Energy (RE) production following the Paris Agreement with some countries even setting a goal of 100% by 2025. The reasons are twofold: capitalizing on carbon emissions whilst concomitantly benefiting from reduced fossil fuel dependence and the fluctuations associated with imported fuel prices. However, numerous countries have not yet made preparations to increase RE production and integration. In many instances, this reluctance seems to be predominant in energy-rich countries, which typically provide heavy subsidies on electricity prices. With such subsidies, there is no incentive to invest in RE since the time taken to recoup such investments would be significant. We develop a model using a Neural Network (NN) regression algorithm to quantitatively illustrate this conjecture and also use it to predict the reduction in electricity price subsidies required to achieve a specified RE production target. The model was trained using 10 leading metrics from 53 countries. It is envisaged that policymakers and researchers can use this model to plan future RE targets to satisfy the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) and determine the required electricity subsidy reductions. The model can easily be modified to predict what changes in other country factors can be made to stimulate growth in RE production. We illustrate this approach with a sample use case.

AB This paper presents a methodology for the development and implementation of Model Predictive Control (MPC) in institutional buildings. This methodology relies on Artificial Intelligence (AI) for model development. An appropriate control-oriented model is a critical component in MPC; model development is no easy task, and it often requires significant technical expertise, effort and time, along with a substantial amount of information. AI techniques enable rapid development and calibration of models using a limited amount of information (i.e. measurements of few variables) while achieving relatively high accuracy. In this study, the MPC algorithm targets the reduction of natural gas consumption by optimizing the transition between night set-back and daytime indoor air set-point values as a function of the expected weather. This MPC strategy was implemented in an institutional building in Varennes (QC), Canada, during the heating season 2018-19. A significantly better performance was achieved when compared with "business as usual" control strategies: the natural gas consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were reduced by approximately 22%, and the building heating demand by 4.3%. The proposed strategy is scalable and can be replicated in other buildings. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As the level of greenhouse gas emissions increases, so does the importance of the energy performance of buildings (EPB). One of the main factors to measure EPB is a structure's heating load (HL) and cooling load (CL). HLs and CLs depend on several variables, such as relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution. This research uses deep neural networks (DNNs) to forecast HLs and CLs for a variety of structures. The DNNs explored in this research include multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks, and each of the models in this research was developed through extensive testing with a myriad number of layers, process elements, and other data preprocessing techniques. As a result, a DNN is shown to be an improvement for modeling HLs and CLs compared to traditional artificial neural network (ANN) models. In order to extract knowledge from a trained model, a post-processing technique, called sensitivity analysis (SA), was applied to the model that performed the best with respect to the selected goodness-of-fit metric on an independent set of testing data. There are two forms of SA-local and global methods-but both have the same purpose in terms of determining the significance of independent variables within a model. Local SA assumes inputs are independent of each other, while global SA does not. To further the contribution of the research presented within this article, the results of a global SA, called state-based sensitivity analysis (SBSA), are compared to the results obtained from a traditional local technique, called sensitivity analysis about the mean (SAAM). The results of the research demonstrate an improvement over existing conclusions found in literature, which is of particular interest to decision-makers and designers of building structures.

AB As one of the three major fields of building energy consumption, public buildings (PBs)are under pressure regarding energy saving and emission reductions, with PB energy consumption accounting for 38% of the total consumption. Thus, CO2 emissions released in PBs have become crucial for China in achieving its emission mitigation goal in the "Post Paris" period. This paper is the first to develop a support vector machine (SVM) method to predict and diagnose PB energy consumption based on 11 input parameters, including historical energy consumption data, climatic factors and time-cycle factors. Months with air-conditioning energy consumption in Wuhan were considered the study period, and we used June and July data for model prediction training, August data as the test set, and September data to diagnose the air conditioner energy consumption anomaly. The results show that air conditioning energy consumption was abnormal for four days in September. Relevant policies and suggestions are proposed based on the causal analysis. This research is expected to provide theoretical guidance and a practical data reference for building operations management. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the extensive electrification introduced into the shipboard power systems, the navigation routine has become more important in an electric propulsion and solar power integrated ships since various sailing paths and speeds will lead to different operation performances. Unlike traditional navigation, which solves the shortest path problem, a data-driven optimization scheme is developed in this article for a photovoltaic (PV)-dependent navigation routing. In order to minimize the total cost and greenhouse gas emissions of an all-electric ship (AES), a new coordinated optimization framework is proposed to jointly optimize the energy storage system (ESS) sizing and voyage scheduling while considering solar power variations. Several cases are compared to verify the proposed method on a cargo ship, and numeral results reveal that the deep-learning-based forecasting method can better characterize the onboard solar power variations, and the proposed joint optimization framework can well accommodate the onboard PV generation.

AB In developed countries, buildings are involved in almost 50% of total energy use and 30% of global annual greenhouse gas emissions. The operational energy needs of buildings are highly dependent on various building physical, operational, and functional characteristics, as well as meteorological and temporal properties. Besides physics-based energy modeling of buildings, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the capability to provide faster and higher accuracy estimates, given buildings' historic energy consumption data. Looking beyond individual building levels, forecasting building energy performance can help city and community managers have a better understanding of their future energy needs, and to plan for satisfying them more efficiently. Focusing at an urban scale, this research develops a campus energy use prediction tool for predicting the effects of long-term climate change on the energy performance of buildings using AI techniques. The tool comprises four steps: Data Collection, AI Development, Model Validation, and Model Implementation, and can predict the energy use of campus buildings with 90% accuracy. We have relied on energy use data of buildings situated in the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida (FL). To study the impact of climate change, we have used climate properties of three future weather files of Gainesville, FL, developed by the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), represented based on their impact: median (year 2063), hottest (2057), and coldest (2041).

AB Energy management and reduction of CO2 emission lead to many investigates about energy input-output analyses especially in agricultural sector. The main objectives of this study are to assess the energy use pattern and to select the best method among Cobb-Douglas (CD), multiple linear regressions (MLR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function (RBF) and support vector machine (SVM) models to estimate potato output energy in Jiroft city, located in the south of Kerman province, Iran. Data were collected with questioner method from expert farmers. Results indicated that the average of total input energy is about 84309.43 MJ ha(-1) and the average of total output energy is 130217.14 MJ ha(-1). Irrigation water (36%) and fertilizers (26%) were found to be the most important energy inputs in potato production. Unlike most literature reviews, in this study for better and more accurate model evolutions in energy forecasting, five different sizes of training selection (TS) were used: 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% and 90%. Some statistical indexes (RMSE, MAPE, and R-2) of the different data selection calculated from k-fold in two training sets. The results showed that RBF model has a great prediction performance at all different values of training data selection. The average value of R-2 was found to be more than 0.98. Between SVM and MLP models, the test performance will be improved by size reduction of training selection. Thus, the RBF model is chosen as the best model for fitting and modeling the output energy of potato production.

AB In a climate-constrained world, it is crucial to reduce natural gas methane emissions, which can potentially offset the climate benefits of replacing coal with gas. Optical gas imaging (OGI) is a widely-used method to detect methane leaks, but is labor-intensive and cannot provide leak detection results without operators' judgment. In this paper, we develop a computer vision approach for OGI-based leak detection using convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained on methane leak images to enable automatic detection. First, we collect similar to 1 M frames of labeled videos of methane leaks from different leaking equipment, covering a wide range of leak sizes (5.3-2051.6 g CH4/h) and imaging distances (4.6-15.6 m). Second, we examine different background subtraction methods to extract the methane plume in the foreground. Third, we then test three CNN model variants, collectively called GasNet, to detect plumes in videos. We assess the ability of GasNet to perform leak detection by comparing it to a baseline method that uses an optical-flow based change detection algorithm. We explore the sensitivity of results to the CNN structure, with a moderate-complexity variant performing best across distances. The generated detection probability curves show that the detection accuracy (fraction of leak and non-leak images correctly identified by the algorithm) can reach as high as 99%, the overall detection accuracy can exceed 95% across all leak sizes and imaging distances. Binary detection accuracy exceeds 97% for large leaks (similar to 710 g CH4/h) imaged closely (similar to 5-7 m). The GasNet-based computer vision approach could be deployed in OGI surveys for automatic vigilance of methane leak detection with high accuracy in the real world.

AB Renewable Energy Communities consist in an emerging decentralized market mechanism which allows local energy exchanges between end-users, bypassing the traditional wholesale/retail market structure. In that configuration, local consumers and prosumers gather in communities and can either cooperate or compete towards a common objective, such as the minimization of the electricity costs and/or the minimization of greenhouse gas emissions for instance. This paper proposes data analytics modules which aim at helping the community members to schedule the usage of their resources (generation and consumption) in order to minimize their electricity bill. A day-ahead local wind power forecasting algorithm, which relies on state-of-the-art Machine Learning techniques currently used in worldwide forecasting contests, is in that way proposed. We develop furthermore an original method to improve the performance of neural network forecasting models in presence of abnormal wind power data. A technique for computing representative profiles of the community members electricity consumption is also presented. The proposed techniques are tested and deployed operationally on a pilot Renewable Energy Community established on an Medium Voltage network in Belgium, involving 2.25 MW of wind and 18 Small and Medium Enterprises who had the possibility to freely access the results of the developed data modules by connecting to a dedicated web platform. We first show that our method for dealing with abnormal wind power data improves the forecasting accuracy by 10% in terms of Root Mean Square Error. The impact of the developed data modules on the consumption behaviour of the community members is then quantified, by analyzing the evolution of their monthly self-consumption and self-sufficiency during the pilot. No significant changes in the members behaviour, in relation with the information provided by the models, were observed in the recorded data. The pilot was however perturbed by the COVID-19 crisis which had a significant impact on the economic activity of the involved companies. We conclude by providing recommendations for the future set up of similar communities.

AB Shipping industry is the backbone of global trade. However, the large quantities of greenhouse gas emissions from shipping, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), cannot be ignored. In order to comply with the international environmental regulations as well as to increase commercial profits, shipping companies have stronger motivations to improve ship energy efficiency. In this study, a two-stage ship fuel consumption prediction and reduction model is proposed for a dry bulk ship. At the first stage, a fuel consumption prediction model based on random forest regressor is proposed and validated. The prediction model takes into account ship sailing speed, total cargo weight, and sea and weather conditions and then predicts hourly fuel consumption of the main engine. The mean absolute percentage error of the random forest regressor is 7.91%. At the second stage, a speed optimization model is developed based on the prediction model proposed at the first stage while guaranteeing the estimated arrival time to the destination port. Numerical experiment on two consecutive-8-day voyages shows that the proposed model can reduce ship fuel consumption by 2-7%. The reduction in ship fuel consumption will also lead to lower CO2 emissions.

AB The electric sector is majorly concerned about the greenhouse and non-greenhouse gas emissions generated from both conventional and renewable energy sources, as this is becoming a major issue globally. Thus, the utilities must adhere to certain environmental guidelines for sustainable power generation. Therefore, this paper presents a novel nature-inspired and population-based Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) methodology for controlling the emissions from thermal generating sources by solving single and multi-objective Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems. The OPF is a non-linear, non-convex, constrained optimization problem that primarily aims to minimize the fitness function by satisfying the equality and inequality constraints of the system. The cooperative behavior and dynamic chasing patterns of hawks to pounce on escaping prey is modeled mathematically to minimize the objective function. In this paper, fuel cost, real power loss and environment emissions are regarded as single and multi-objective functions for optimal adjustments of power system control variables. The different conflicting framed multi-objective functions have been solved using weighted sums using a no-preference method. The presented method is coded using MATLAB software and an IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 30-bus. The system was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of selective objectives. The obtained results are compared with the other Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques such as the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA), Moth Flame (MF) and Glow Warm Optimization (GWO). Additionally, the study on placement of Distributed Generation (DG) reveals that the system losses and emissions are reduced by an amount of 9.8355% and 26.2%, respectively.
