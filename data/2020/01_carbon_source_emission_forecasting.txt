AB Spreading green and low-consumption transportation methods is becoming an urgent priority. Ride-sharing, which refers to the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travel in a car, and prevents the need for others to drive to a location themselves, is a critical solution to this issue. Before being introduced into one place, it needs a potential analysis. However, current studies did this kind of analysis based on home and work locations or social ties between people, which is not precise and straight enough. Few pieces of research departed from real mobility data, but uses time-consuming methodology. In this paper, we proposed an analysis framework to bridge this gap. We chose the case study of Tokyo area with over 1 million GPS travel records and trained a deep learning model to find out this potential. From the computation result, on average, nearly 26.97% of travel distance could be saved by ride-sharing, which told us that there is a significant similarity in the travel pattern of people in Tokyo and there is considerable potential of ride-sharing. Moreover, if half of the original public transit riders in our study case adopt ride-sharing, the quantity of CO2 is estimated to be reduced by 84.52%; if all of the original public transit riders in our study case adopt ride-sharing, 83.56% of CO2 emission reduction can be expected with a rebound effect because of increase of participants from public transit. Ride-sharing can not only improve the air quality of these center business districts but also alleviate some city problems like traffic congestion. We believe the analysis of the potential of ride-sharing can provide insight into the decision making of ride-sharing service providers and decision-makers.

AB With the aim of enabling effective flexible electricity demand, a machine learning algorithm is developed to forecast the CO2 emission intensities in European electrical power grids distinguishing between average and marginal emissions. The analysis focuses on Danish bidding zone DK2 and was done on a data set comprised of a large number (473) of explanatory variables such as power production, demand, import, weather conditions etc., collected from selected neighboring zones. The number of variables was reduced to less than 30 using both LASSO (a penalized linear regression analysis) and a forward feature selection algorithm. Three linear regression models that capture different aspects of the data (non-linearities and coupling of variables etc.), were created and combined into a final model using Softmax weighted average. Cross-validation is performed for debiasing and an autoregressive moving average model (ARIMA) implemented to correct the residuals, making the final model an ARIMA with exogenous inputs (ARIMAX). Forecast errors vary between 0.095 and 0.183 (NRMSE) for the average emissions and 0.029-0.160 for the marginals depending on the forecast horizon (1-24 h). The forecasts with the corresponding uncertainties are analyzed and performance on very short (below six hours) and longer horizons are discussed. One interesting result is that the marginal emissions were shown to be highly independent of any variables in the DK2 zone, suggesting that the marginal generators are located in the neighboring zones. The developed methodology can be applied to any bidding zone in the European electricity network without requiring detailed knowledge about the zone and with very few manual interactions.

AB Many calculation methods have been developed to forecast carbon emissions (CE). These methods can be classified into two categories: time series prediction and variables regression. However, time series prediction cannot fully use all CE-related information and variables regression can only predict CE by knowing other variables in advance. To solve these problems, KLS is proposed in this paper which is a fusion of Kalman filter (KF), long short-term memory (LSTM), and support vector machine (SVM). LSTM is used to predict CE as a time series, and 10 of 14 variables are selected by ridge regression (RR) to regress CE by SVM. Finally, KF is used to integrate the results of LSTM and SVM based on their variances. Overall, statistical filtering and deep learning algorithms are used in this paper, which achieved the fusion of time series prediction and variables regression. To confirm the effectiveness of KLS, we trained KLS model by CE from 1965 to 2005 and tested the model by the data from 2006 to 2014. The results showed KLS was more accurate than other four existing methods. Finally, we predicted the CE of China in next decade.

AB The analyzed research issue provides a model for Carbon Footprint estimation at an early design stage. In the context of climate neutrality, it is important to introduce regenerative design practices in the architect's design process, especially in early design phases when the possibility of modifying the design is usually high. The research method was based on separate consecutive research works-partial tasks: Developing regenerative design guidelines for simulation purposes and for parametric modeling; generating a training set and a testing set of building designs with calculated total Carbon Footprint; using the pre-generated set to train a Machine Learning Model; applying the Machine Learning Model to predict optimal building features; prototyping an application for a quick estimation of the Total Carbon Footprint in the case of other projects in early design phases; updating the prototyped application with additional features; urban layout analysis; preparing a new approach based on Convolutional Neural Networks and training the new algorithm; and developing the final version of the application that can predict the Total Carbon Footprint of a building design based on basic building features and on the urban layout. The results of multi-criteria analyses showed relationships between the parameters of buildings and the possibility of introducing Carbon Footprint estimation and implementing building optimization at the initial design stage.

AB A reliable quantification of greenhouse gas emissions is a basis for the development of adequate mitigation measures. Protocols for emission measurements and data analysis approaches to extrapolate to accurate annual emission values are a substantial prerequisite in this context. We systematically analyzed the benefit of supervised machine learning methods to project methane emissions from a naturally ventilated cattle building with a concrete solid floor and manure scraper located in Northern Germany. We took into account approximately 40 weeks of hourly emission measurements and compared model predictions using eight regression approaches, 27 different sampling scenarios and four measures of model accuracy. Data normalization was applied based on median and quartile range. A correlation analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of individual features. This indicated only a very weak linear relation between the methane emission and features that are typically used to predict methane emission values of naturally ventilated barns. It further highlighted the added value of including day-time and squared ambient temperature as features. The error of the predicted emission values was in general below 10%. The results from Gaussian processes, ordinary multilinear regression and neural networks were least robust. More robust results were obtained with multilinear regression with regularization, support vector machines and particularly the ensemble methods gradient boosting and random forest. The latter had the added value to be rather insensitive against the normalization procedure. In the case of multilinear regression, also the removal of not significantly linearly related variables (i.e., keeping only the day-time component) led to robust modeling results. We concluded that measurement protocols with 7 days and six measurement periods can be considered sufficient to model methane emissions from the dairy barn with solid floor with manure scraper, particularly when periods are distributed over the year with a preference for transition periods. Features should be normalized according to median and quartile range and must be carefully selected depending on the modeling approach.

AB Mitigating the substantial undesirable impact of transportation systems on the environment is paramount. Thus, predicting Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions is one of the profound topics, especially with the emergence of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). We developed a deep learning framework to predict link-level GHG emission rate (ER) (in CO2eq gram/second) based on the most representative predictors, such as speed, density, and GHG ER of previous time steps. In particular, various specifications of the long short-term memory (LSTM) networks with explanatory variables were examined, and were compared with clustering and the autore-gressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model with explanatory variables. The downtown Toronto road network was used as the study area, and highly detailed data were synthesized using a calibrated traffic microsimulation and MOVES. It was found that LSTM specification with speed, density, GHG ER, and in-links speed from three previous minutes performed the best while adopting two hidden layers, and when the hyper-parameters were systematically tuned. Adopting a 30-second updating interval slightly improved the correlation between true (simulated) and predicted GHG ERs (from predictive models), but contributed negatively to the prediction accuracy as reflected in the increased root mean square error (RMSE) value. Efficiently predicting GHG emissions at a higher frequency with lower data requirements will pave the way for various applications, e.g. anticipatory eco-routing in large-scale road networks to alleviate the adverse impact on global warming.

AB A new government report on climate change shows that global emissions of greenhouse gases have increased to very high levels despite various policies to reduce climate change. Building energy accounts for 40% of the world's energy consumption and accounts for 33% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. This study applied the LEAP (Long-range energy alternatives planning) model and Bass diffusion method for predicting the total energy consumption and GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions from the residential and commercial building sector of Sejong City in South Korea. Then, using the Bass diffusion model, three scenarios were analyzed (REST: Renewable energy supply target, BES: Building energy saving, BEP: Building energy policy) for GHG reduction. The GHG emissions for Sejong City for 2015-2030 were analyzed, and the past and future GHG emissions of the city were predicted in a Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario. In the REST scenario, the GHG emissions would attain a 24.5% reduction and, in the BES scenario, the GHG emissions would attain 12.81% reduction by 2030. Finally, the BEP scenario shows the potential for a 19.81% GHG reduction. These results could be used to guide the planning and development of the new city.

AB Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used to study complex environmental phenomena with high variability in time and space. In this study, the potential of exploiting three categories of ML regression models, including classical regression, shallow learning and deep learning for predicting soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from an agricultural field was explored. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes, as well as various environmental, agronomic and soil data were measured at the site over a five-year period in Quebec, Canada. The rigorous analysis, which included statistical comparison and cross-validation for the prediction of CO2 and N2O fluxes, confirmed that the LSTM model performed the best among the considered ML models with the highest R coefficient and the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) values (R = 0.87 and RMSE = 30.3 mg.m(-2).hr(-1) for CO2 flux prediction and R = 0.86 and RMSE = 0.19 mg.m(-2).hr(-1) for N2O flux prediction). The predictive performances of LSTM were more accurate than those simulated in a previous study conducted by a biophysical-based Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2). The classical regression models (namely RF, SVM and LASSO) satisfactorily simulated cyclical and seasonal variations of CO2 fluxes (R = 0.75, 0.71 and 0.68, respectively); however, they failed to reasonably predict the peak values of N2O fluxes (R < 0.25). Shallow ML was found to be less effective in predicting GHG fluxes than other considered ML models (R < 0.7 for CO2 flux and R < 0.3 for estimating N2O fluxes) and was the most sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. Based on this comprehensive comparison study, it was elicited that the LSTM model can be employed successfully in simulating GHG emissions from agricultural soils, providing a new perspective on the application of machine learning modeling for predicting GHG emissions to the environment.

AB Frequent cloud cover in the tropics significantly affects the observation of the surface by satellites. This has enormous implications for current approaches that estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fires or map fire scars. These mainly employ data acquired in the visible to middle infrared bands to map fire scars or thermal data to estimate fire radiative power and consequently derive emissions. The analysis here instead explores the use of microwave data from the operational Sentinel-1A (S-1A) in dual-polarisation mode (VV and VH) acquired over Central Kalimantan during the 2015 fire season. Burnt areas were mapped in three consecutive periods between August and October 2015 using the random forests machine learning algorithm. In each mapping period, the omission and commission errors of the unburnt class were always below 3%, while the omission and commission errors of the burnt class were below 20% and 5% respectively. Summing the detections from the three periods gave a total burnt area of similar to 1.6 million ha, but this dropped to similar to 1.2 million ha if using only a pair of pre- and post-fire season S-1A images. Hence the ability of Sentinel-1 to make frequent observations significantly increases fire scar detection. Comparison with burnt area estimates from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) burnt area product at 5 km scale showed poor agreement, with consistently much lower estimates produced by the MODIS data-on average 14%-51% of those obtained in this study. The method presented in this study offers a way to reduce the substantial errors likely to occur in optical-based estimates of GHG emissions from fires in tropical areas affected by substantial cloud cover.

AB Environmental protection efforts can only be effective in the long term with a reliable quantification of pollutant gas emissions as a first step to mitigation. Measurement and analysis strategies must permit the accurate extrapolation of emission values. We systematically analyzed the added value of applying modern machine learning methods in the process of monitoring emissions from naturally ventilated livestock buildings to the atmosphere. We considered almost 40 weeks of hourly emission values from a naturally ventilated dairy cattle barn in Northern Germany. We compared model predictions using 27 different scenarios of temporal sampling, multiple measures of model accuracy, and eight different regression approaches. The error of the predicted emission values with the tested measurement protocols was, on average, well below 20%. The sensitivity of the prediction to the selected training dataset was worse for the ordinary multilinear regression. Gradient boosting and random forests provided the most accurate and robust emission value predictions, accompanied by the second-smallest model errors. Most of the highly ranked scenarios involved six measurement periods, while the scenario with the best overall performance was: One measurement period in summer and three in the transition periods, each lasting for 14 days.

AB Ozone is one of the most important greenhouse gases and air pollutants in urban areas, and has significantly negative impacts both on the climate change and human health. In addition to alert the public for health concerns, accurate ozone prediction is also crucial to understand the formation mechanisms of surface ozone episodes, and has significant implications for making emission control strategies of ozone precursors such as methane, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds. However, existing methods of ozone concentration prediction could not effectively capture temporal dependency, and most neglect spatial correlations. In this study, a hybrid sequence to sequence model embedded with the attention mechanism is proposed for predicting regional ground-level ozone concentration. In the proposed model, the inherent spatiotemporal correlations in air quality monitoring network are simultaneously extracted, learned and incorporated, and auxiliary air pollution and meteorological information are adaptively involved. The hourly data collected from 35 air quality monitoring stations and 651 meteorological girds in Beijing, China are used to validate the present model. The results demonstrate that the spatiotemporal correlations in the monitoring network present enormous advantages for the regional ozone prediction. Auxiliary data and time lags matching day-of-week or diurnal periods of ozone are confirmed to benefit the improvement of prediction accuracy. Monitoring stations in urban areas exhibit better prediction performances than stations in remote areas. The addressed model outperforms the baseline models, and is proven to have excellent performance in all monitoring station categories of Beijing and different months with significant disparity of ozone concentrations.

AB The main purpose of this paper is to develop an efficient multi-stage methodology to predict carbon dioxide emissions based on two important variables including the energy consumption and economic growth using the clustering, prediction machine learning techniques, and dimensionality reduction. To do so, we use the self-organizing map clustering algorithm to cluster the data and the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and artificial neural network to construct the prediction models in each cluster of the self-organizing map to predict carbon dioxide emissions considering a set of input parameters including economic growth and energy consumption in Group 20 nations. Furthermore, we use the singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and missing values' prediction in the dataset. The results of the analysis of a real-world dataset found that the developed multi-stage approach was capable of predicting the carbon dioxide emissions on two indicators. To validate the proposed method, the results are compared with other existing methods. The outcomes demonstrate that the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system and artificial neural network techniques combined with the self-organizing map and singular value decomposition technique provide 0.065 accuracy in terms of the mean average error. In addition, when comparing singular value decomposition-self-organizing map-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system method with the singular value decomposition-self-organizing map-adaptive-artificial neural network method, the singular value decomposition-self-organizing map-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference provides with 0.104 accuracy in predicting CO2 emissions. Moreover, the multiple linear regression provides the worst accuracy (0.522) results compared with the artificial neural network and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system techniques. The analysis regarding the relationship between economic development, carbon dioxide emissions, and the energy consumption is extremely vital from the energy and economic policy-making aspects in Group 20 countries given that the primary focus of this group has been the governance of the global economy.

AB Carbon trading is regarded as an important measure to reduce carbon emissions. To provide more accurate carbon prediction results for policymakers and market participants, a hybrid carbon price prediction model combines empirical mode decomposition, variational mode decomposition, and long short-term memory network is proposed. The empirical analysis was conducted based on the actual data of all eight carbon market pilots in China. According to the results of empirical analysis, several main conclusions can be summarized. First, the prediction accuracy and robustness of the proposed model are optimal in comparison experiments. In the Beijing carbon market, the MAPE, RMSE, and R2 of the proposed model improved by 63.98%, 66.07%, and 12.24%, respectively, compared with the worst model. Second, the secondary decomposition can effectively improve the prediction accuracy. In the Beijing dataset, the combination of empirical mode decomposition and variational mode decomposition improved the MAPE, RMSE, and R2 values of the model by an average of 35.52%, 46.57%, and 8.94%. Third, the carbon market in Hubei province is relatively mature, while the carbon market in Tianjin is relatively low in maturity. The study can make a theoretical and practical contribution to the literature within this realm. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Stream networks transport and emit substantial volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. We gathered open monitoring data from streams in three Scandinavian countries and estimated CO2 partial pressure (pCO(2)) at 2,298 sites. Most of the sites (87%) were supersaturated when averaged across the year with an overall mean pCO(2) of 1,464 mu atm (range: 17-15,646). Using remote sensing data, we modeled a realistic stream network including streams above similar to 2.5 m wide and calculated catchment averages of multiple variables associated with geomorphometry, stream network proximity, and land cover. We compared the ability of eight machine learning models to predict pCO(2) and found that the Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy, with a root-mean-square error of 0.22 (log(10)(pCO(2))) and R-2 of 0.66. Mean catchment elevation, slope, and permanent water cover were the most important predictor variables. We used the predictive model to create a high-resolution (25-m resolution) map with predicted stream pCO(2) throughout the 268.807 km stream network in Denmark, Sweden, and Finland. Predicted pCO(2) averaged 1,134 mu atm (range: 154-8,174). We used surface runoff, air temperature, and stream channel slope to estimate gas transfer velocity and CO2 flux throughout the network. Mean stream CO2 fluxes ranged from 1.0 and 1.2 in Sweden and Finland, respectively, 3 to 3.2 g C m(-2) day(-1) in Denmark. Better-performing models improve our ability to predict pCO(2) in stream networks and reduce the uncertainty of upscaling estimates of carbon emissions from inland waters to countries and continents.

AB Methane flux (FCH4) measurements using the eddy covariance technique have increased over the past decade. FCH4 measurements commonly include data gaps, as is the case with CO2 and energy fluxes. However, gap-filling FCH4 data are more challenging than other fluxes due to its unique characteristics including multidriver dependency, variabilities across multiple timescales, nonstationarity, spatial heterogeneity of flux footprints, and lagged influence of biophysical drivers. Some researchers have applied a marginal distribution sampling (MDS) algorithm, a standard gap-filling method for other fluxes, to FCH4 datasets, and others have applied artificial neural networks (ANN) to resolve the challenging characteristics of FCH4. However, there is still no consensus regarding FCH4 gap-filling methods due to limited comparative research. We are not aware of the applications of machine learning (ML) algorithms beyond ANN to FCH4 datasets. Here, we compare the performance of MDS and three ML algorithms (ANN, random forest [RF], and support vector machine [SVM]) using multiple combinations of ancillary variables. In addition, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) as an input to the algorithms to address multidriver dependency of FCH4 and reduce the internal complexity of the algorithmic structures. We applied this approach to five benchmark FCH4 datasets from both natural and managed systems located in temperate and tropical wetlands and rice paddies. Results indicate that PCA improved the performance of MDS compared to traditional inputs. ML algorithms performed better when using all available biophysical variables compared to using PCA-derived inputs. Overall, RF was found to outperform other techniques for all sites. We found gap-filling uncertainty is much larger than measurement uncertainty in accumulated CH4 budget. Therefore, the approach used for FCH4 gap filling can have important implications for characterizing annual ecosystem-scale methane budgets, the accuracy of which is important for evaluating natural and managed systems and their interactions with global change processes.

AB De-carbonization of the transport sector is an important pathway to climate-change mitigation and presents the potential for future lower emissions. To assess the potential quantitatively under different optimization measures, this paper presents a hybrid model combining an integrated machine learning model with the scenario analysis. We compare the training accuracy of the back-propagation neural networks (BPNN), Gaussian process regression (GPR), and support vector machine (SVM) fitting model with different training datasets. The results indicate that the performance of the SVM model is superior to other methods. And the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is then used to optimize hyper-parameters of the SVM model. Two scenarios including business as usual (BAU) and best case (BC) are set according to the current trends and target trends of driving factors identified by the extended stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model. Finally, to find the de-carbonization potentials in the transport sector, the PSO-SVM model is applied to predict transport emissions from 2015 to 2030 under two scenarios. Results show that transport emissions reduce by about 131.36 million tons during 2015-2020 and 372.86 million tons during 2021-2025 in the BC scenario. The findings can effectively track, test, and predict the achievement of policy goals and provide practical guidance for de-carbonization development.

AB Quantification of methane (CH4) gas emission from peat is critical to understand CH4 budget from natural wetlands under a climate warming scenario. Previous studies have focused on prediction and mapping of CH4 emission flux using process-based models, while application of statistical-empirical models for upscaling spatially sparse in situ measurements is scarce. In this study, we developed an empirical remote sensing upscaling approach to estimate CH4 emission flux in the Everglades using limited in situ point-based CH4 emission flux measurements and Landsat data during 2013-2018. We spatially and temporally linked in situ data with Landsat surface reflectance based on temporally composite data sets and developed an object-based machine learning framework to model and map CH4 emission flux. An ensemble analysis of two machine learning models, k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), shows that the upscaling approach is promising for predicting CH4 emission flux with a R-2 of 0.65 and 0.87 based on a fivefold cross-validation for a dry season and wet season estimation, respectively. We generated emission flux map products that successfully revealed the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of CH4 emission within the dominant freshwater marsh ecosystem in the Everglades. We conclude that Landsat is promising for upscaling and monitoring CH4 emission flux and reducing the uncertainty in emission estimates from wetlands.

AB The correspondence among energy use, carbon dioxide emissions, and growth is a matter of discussion among policymakers, economists, and researchers. It is not possible to deny that the concept of sustainable development inspires their enquiry into this arena. The primary aspiration of this work is to use machine learning techniques in the prediction of carbon dioxide emissions and growth by taking energy use as the input variable. Our findings suggest that the prediction accuracy of the relation between CO2 emission and growth can improve by using machine learning techniques. In this case, prediction using Adam optimization is better than stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in the context of carbon dioxide emissions and growth. Furthermore, the result highlights that the change from fossil fuel use to renewable energy use is a possible way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions without sacrificing economic growth. Hence, the policy has to be articulated in such way as to reduce fossil fuel use or increase energy efficiency, and at the same time, new investment has to be initiated in the renewable energy sector to promote economic growth in India.

AB Greenhouses provide controlled environmental conditions for crop cultivation but require careful management to ensure ideal growing conditions. In this study, we tested three deep-learning-based neural network models (Artificial neural network, ANN; Nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model, NARX; and Recurrent neural networks - Long short-term memory, RNN-LSTM) to determine the best approach to predicting environmental changes in temperature, humidity, and CO2 within a greenhouse to improve management strategies. This study determined the prediction performance for time steps from 5 to 30 min and showed that the accuracy of the time-based algorithm gradually decreased as prediction time increased. The best model for all datasets was RNN-LSTM, even after 30 min, with an R-2 of 0.96 for temperature, 0.80 for humidity, and 0.81 for CO2 concentration. The results of this study show that it is possible to apply deep-learning-based prediction models for more precisely managing greenhouse.

AB Estimation and mapping of wetland methane (CH4) emission is carried out from the wetlands of mature Ganges deltaic environment of India. Wetlands are firstly demarcated into six types and CH4 emission is estimated for each wetland types during pre and post-monsoon seasons in order to assess seasonality effects on methanogenesis across wetland habitat types. Water Richness (WR) of the wetlands area was also assessed using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to investigate its effect on CH4 emission. Results show significant variation of wetland CH4 emission influenced by WR and seasonality. Very high WR zone is found over almost 18% wetland area where average monthly emission is< 0.5 ton/km(2). This rate is much lower than the average monthly emission of very low WR zone (> 3.0 ton/km(2)) covering more than 35% of the wetland area. Average monthly emission during pre-monsoon season is about 0.18 ton/km(2) and which decreases to 0.15 ton/km(2) during post-monsoon season. Considerable seasonal wetland areas make greater total CH4 emission during post-monsoon month than pre-monsoon. Highest average monthly emission rate is found over lakes which is 1.73 ton/km(2) during premonsoon and reduces to 0.54 ton/km(2) during post-monsoon followed by marshy wetlands. The bheries (local name of embanked wetland diurnally controlled by tidal water mainly used for pisciculture) show the lowest emission rate which is not more than 0.08 ton/km(2).

AB Intelligent Transportation System is one of the most influential pillars for the citizens in a city to lead a quality life. With rapid urbanisation and the growth of motor vehicles, environment is imposed with serious hazards because of heavy traffic congestion, CO2 emissions and other pollutants. Due to traffic congestion, energy consumption by motor vehicles is also increased in a drastic manner. Most of the cities in India, particularly Delhi is the most air pollutant place due to high consumption of petroleum products by motor vehicles. In general, 1 litre of motor fuel will produce 2.3 kg of CO2 emission. These issues cause adverse health related problems and in turn reduces the socio-economic growth of a country. These aforementioned issues can be overcome by visualising the data using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques which provides a better solution by forecasting fuel consumption in each region and the major petroleum products utilised. The proposed work focuses on fuel forecasting and comparison of petroleum products consumption in regional and state wise of our country. Visualisation of widely used petroleum products, year wise growth of top three regions, top five states and prediction of fuel consumption for next 10 years is done using descriptive analytics and Trend analysis. The outcome of these analyses gives a clear picture on congested traffic places and the ways to improve the environment quality by implementing proper traffic management system.

AB Despite the growing interest in digital twins (DTs) in geospatial technology, the scientific literature is still at the early stage, and concepts of DTs vary. In common perspectives, the primary goals of DTs are to reduce the uncertainty of the physical systems in real-world projects to reduce cost. Thus, this study is aimed at developing a structural schematic of a geographic information system (GIS)-enabled DT system and exploring geospatial technologies that can aid in deploying a DT system for a real-world project-in particular, for the sustainable evaluation of carbon emissions. The schematic includes three major phases: (1) data collection and visualization, (2) analytics, and (3) deployment. Three steps are designed to propose an optimal strategy to reduce carbon emissions in an urban area. In the analytics phase, mapping, machine learning algorithms, and spatial statistics are applied, mapping an ideal counterpart to physical assets. Furthermore, not only are GIS maps able to analyze geographic data that represent the counterparts of physical assets but can also display and analyze spatial relationships between physical assets. In the first step of the analytics phase, a GIS map spatially represented the most vulnerable area based on the values of carbon emissions computed according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines. Next, the radial basis function (RBF) kernel algorithm, a machine learning technique, was used to forecast spatial trends of carbon emissions. A backpropagation neural network (BPNN) was used to quantitatively determine which factor was the most influential among the four data sources: electricity, city gas, household waste, and vehicle. Then, a hot spot analysis was used to assess where high values of carbon emissions clustered in the study area. This study on the development of DTs contributes the following. First, with DTs, sustainable urban management systems will be improved and new insights developed more publicly. Ultimately, such improvements can reduce the failures of projects associated with urban planning and management. Second, the structural schematic proposed here is a data-driven approach; consequently, its outputs are more reliable and feasible. Ultimately, innovative approaches become available and services are transformed. Consequently, urban planners or policy makers can apply the system to scenario-based approaches.

AB In this study, we explored different methods to build methane emissions prediction models of temperate reservoirs on a regional field scale, and then we examined the performances and adaptation of these prediction models. First, four statistical model learning methods and two machine learning methods were used to develop methane emissions prediction models based on environmental factors (i.e., temperature and atmospheric pressure) and methane fluxes at three reservoirs (Miyun, Yudushan, and Baihepu) in Beijing, China, from 2009 to 2012. In general, decision trees (DT) exhibited better performance with higher r(2) (the coefficient of determination) and lower root mean squared error, mean deviation, mean squared error, and mean absolute error. Second, in order to examine model adaptation, two experimental datasets were used to build methane emissions prediction models separately: D1 (samples only from Miyun) and D2 (samples from Miyun, Yudushan, and Baihepu). Then, three test data groups which used samples from the three reservoirs separately were used. In general, decision trees (DT) exhibited better performance and adaptation compared to those of other model learning methods. Moreover, our study indicated that it could be necessary to compare greenhouse gas prediction models when compiling greenhouse gas inventories according to IPCC.

AB Polluted urban river systems might be a strong source of atmospheric methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), but so far only a few urban river systems have been quantified with regard to their source strength for greenhouse gases (GHGs). In this study, we measured loads of dissolved inorganic nitrogen and organic carbon, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations, and fluxes of CH4 and N2O from an urban river in Beijing, China during the course of an entire year. Fluxes calculated using the floating chamber approach or via the diffusion method with measurements of river water GHG concentrations showed comparable temporal variations. However, the flux magnitude based on the diffusion method was found to strongly depend on the underlying parameterization of the gas transfer velocity. In view of the large differences while applying different methodologies to estimate surface water GHG fluxes further studies are still needed to prove and eventually quantify the systematic errors which are likely caused by either the chamber technique or the approaches of individual diffusion models. For both the floating chamber and the diffusion-based flux estimates, strong seasonal variations in CH4 and N2O fluxes from the river surface were observed, with fluxes ranging from 3 to 8374 mu g C m(-2) h(-1) for CH4 and 1-3986 mu g N m(-2) h(-1) for N2O. The CH4 fluxes were strongly negatively correlated with the DO concentration (P < 0.01). The highest N2O fluxes were observed at times with low CH4 fluxes (i.e., in spring and autumn). Annual CH4 and N2O fluxes totaled 19.3-79.4 and 17.4-44.8 kg C (N) ha(-1) yr(-1), respectively. These high fluxes are in agreement with estimates from the few other studies carried out for urban river systems to date and indicate that urban polluted river systems are a significant regional source of atmospheric GHGs.

AB Monitoring aboveground carbon stocks and fluxes from tropical deforestation and forest degradation is important for mitigating climate change and improving forest management. However, high temporal and spatial resolution analyses are rare. This study presents the most detailed tracking of aboveground carbon over time, with yearly, quarterly and monthly estimations of emissions using the stock-difference approach and masked by the forest loss layer of Global Forest Watch. We generated high spatial resolution (1-ha) monitoring of aboveground carbon density (ACD) and emissions (ACE) in Peru by incorporating hundreds of thousands of Planet Dove satellite images, Sentinel-1 radar, topography and airborne LiDAR, embedded into a deep learning regression workflow using high-performance computing. Consistent ACD results were obtained for all quarters and months analyzed, with R-2 values of 0.75-0.78, and root mean square errors (RMSE) between 20.6 and 22.0 Mg C ha(-1). A total of 7.138 Pg C was estimated for Peru with annual ACE of 20.08 Tg C between the third quarters of 2017 and 2018, respectively, or 23.4% higher than estimates from the FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment. Analyzed quarterly, the spatial evolution of ACE revealed 11.5 Tg C, 6.6 Tg C, 8.6 Tg C, and 10.1 Tg C lost between the third quarters of 2017 and 2018. Moreover, our monthly analysis for the dry season reveals the evolution of ACE at unprecedented temporal detail. We discuss environmental controls over ACE and provide a spatially explicit tool for enhanced forest carbon management at scale.

AB A rapid development of Internet technologies creates new opportunities for e-commerce, which is one of the fastest-growing segments of the entire economy. For policymakers, the most important aspects of e-commerce are related to the cost reduction in transportation, facilitation of administration and communication, innovations at the market level, and environmental issues. An unavoidable part of the e-commerce production process is related to the postal service. New market expectations of modern society lead to the consideration of upgrading the traditional express delivery service in terms of time availability. In this paper, we propose a new 24-h availability of postal and courier service so-called "post express nonstop". To assess the potential demand for this kind of service, we propose a forecasting procedure based on the Bass diffusion model. In particular, the research is directed toward the examination of environmental issues, considering both types of services-traditional and the proposed new one. A comparison is done by analyzing CO2 emissions in the last-mile delivery of goods to the users' addresses. The experiment was carried out in the city of Belgrade, simulating the last-mile delivery under realistic conditions and controlling the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. In accordance with the results of this experiment and the forecasted number of postal items, a projection of CO2 emissions for the new service from 2020 to 2025 was carried out. The results show a significant contribution of the proposed new express delivery service to environmental well-being and sustainability.
