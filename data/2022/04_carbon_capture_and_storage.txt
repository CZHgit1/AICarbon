AB Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is an essential greenhouse gas-reducing technology that can be employed throughout the energy system. Carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration in underground stratas is one of the effecient ways of reducing carbon emissions. CO2 sequestration in coal formations can be used to improve the methane recovery from coal formations (ECBM). The efficiency of this process highly depend on the wettability of the coal in contact with CO2. Different experimental methods including contact angle (CA) measurments can be used to estimate the wettability. However, the experimental techniques are expensive, incosistant, and timeconsuming. Therefore, this study introduces the application of artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to estimate the CA in coal-water-CO2 system. ANN and ANFIS techniques were built using 250 point dataset to calculate the contact angle of coal formation. The input parameters were the coal properties, operating pressure, and temperature. 70% of the data set was used to train the model, while 30% of the data was used for the testing process. The models were then validated with a set of unseen data. The results showed that ANN and ANFIS models accurately predicted the contact angle in the coal-water-CO2 system as a function of coal properties and the operating conditions. The correlation coefficient (R) and the average absolute percent error (AAPE) between the actual and estimated contact angle were used as indicators for the model performance. ANN and ANFIS models predicted the contact angle with R values higher than 0.96 for the different datasets. AAPE was less than 7% in both models for the training and testing datasets. An empirical equation was built using the weight and biases from the developed ANN model. The new equation was validated with the unseen data set and the R-value was found to be higher than 0.96 with an AAPE less than 6%.these results confirm the reliability of the proposed models to get the contact angle in the coal formation without laboratory work or complex calculations. These models can be used to screen the coal formation targets for carbon storage.

AB Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one approach being studied by the U.S. Department of Energy to help mitigate global warming. The process involves capturing CO2 emissions from industrial sources and permanently storing them in deep geologic formations (storage reservoirs). However, CCS projects generally target "green field sites," where there is often little characterization data and therefore large uncertainty about the petrophysical properties and other geologic attributes of the storage reservoir. Consequently, ensemble-based approaches are often used to forecast multiple realizations prior to CO2 injection to visualize a range of potential outcomes. In addition, monitoring data during injection operations are used to update the pre-injection forecasts and thereby improve agreement between forecasted and observed behavior. Thus, a system for generating accurate, timely forecasts of pressure buildup and CO2 movement and distribution within the storage reservoir and for updating those forecasts via monitoring measurements becomes crucial. This study proposes a learning-based prediction method that can accurately and rapidly forecast spatial distribution of CO2 concentration and pressure with uncertainty quantification without relying on traditional inverse modeling. The machine learning techniques include dimension reduction, multivariate data analysis, and Bayesian learning. The outcome is expected to provide CO2 storage site operators with an effective tool for timely and informative decision making based on limited simulation and monitoring data.

TI Machine Learning-Assisted Prediction of Oil Production and CO2 Storage Effect in CO2-Water-Alternating-Gas Injection (CO2-WAG)

AB In recent years, CO2 flooding has emerged as an efficient method for improving oil recovery. It also has the advantage of storing CO2 underground. As one of the promising types of CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR), CO2 water-alternating-gas injection (CO2-WAG) can suppress CO2 fingering and early breakthrough problems that occur during oil recovery by CO2 flooding. However, the evaluation of CO2-WAG is strongly dependent on the injection parameters, which in turn renders numerical simulations computationally expensive. So, in this work, machine learning is used to help predict how well CO2-WAG will work when different injection parameters are used. A total of 216 models were built by using CMG numerical simulation software to represent CO2-WAG development scenarios of various injection parameters where 70% of them were used as training sets and 30% as testing sets. A random forest regression algorithm was used to predict CO2-WAG performance in terms of oil production, CO2 storage amount, and CO2 storage efficiency. The CO2-WAG period, CO2 injection rate, and water-gas ratio were chosen as the three main characteristics of injection parameters. The prediction results showed that the predicted value of the test set was very close to the true value. The average absolute prediction deviations of cumulative oil production, CO2 storage amount, and CO2 storage efficiency were 1.10%, 3.04%, and 2.24%, respectively. Furthermore, it only takes about 10 s to predict the results of all 216 scenarios by using machine learning methods, while the CMG simulation method spends about 108 min. It demonstrated that the proposed machine-learning method can rapidly predict CO2-WAG performance with high accuracy and high computational efficiency under conditions of various injection parameters. This work gives more insights into the optimization of the injection parameters for CO2-EOR.

AB Solvent based CO2 capture is a promising technology for the decarbonisation of energy and industrial sectors. Online monitoring of the key parameters within the CO2 capture process can provide insight into the operating status of the system and lay the foundation for the controller design. However, limited by current measurement technologies, some important parameters such as CO2 concentration, solvent loading etc. are still difficult to be measured accurately in real time, especially under complex operating conditions. Therefore, this paper presents an intelligent model-based robust soft sensor to monitor the key operating parameters within the CO2 capture process. The robust monitoring approach is consisted by two parts, one is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Network based surrogate model identified using the dynamic operating data generated from a high-precision simulator, which can represent the transient behavior of the carbon capture process over a wide range; while the other part is a moving horizon estimator which fully uses the combination of available process measurements and the developed LSTM network prediction to enhance the reliability of the estimation in the cases of unknown interferences, noises and measurement faults. Simulation results on a large-scale monoethanolamine-based carbon capture process model show that the proposed monitoring method can accurately estimate the clean gas CO2 concentration and lean/ rich solvent loading over a wide operating range, even in the presences of noises and measurement faults.

AB Fast forecasting of the reservoir pressure distribution during geologic carbon storage (GCS) by assimilating monitoring data is a challenging problem. Due to high drilling cost, GCS projects usually have spatially sparse measurements from few wells, leading to high uncertainties in reservoir pressure prediction. To address this challenge, we use low-cost Interferometric Synthetic-Aperture Radar (InSAR) data as monitoring data to infer reservoir pressure build up. We develop a deep learning-accelerated workflow to assimilate surface displacement maps interpreted from InSAR and to forecast dynamic reservoir pressure. Employing an Ensemble Smoother Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) framework, the workflow updates three-dimensional (3D) geologic prop-erties and predicts reservoir pressure with quantified uncertainties. We use a synthetic commercial-scale GCS model with bimodally distributed permeability and porosity to demonstrate the efficacy of the workflow. A two-step CNN-PCA approach is employed to parameterize the bimodal fields. The computational efficiency of the workflow is boosted by two residual U-Net based surrogate models for surface displacement and reservoir pressure predictions, respectively. The workflow can complete data assimilation and reservoir pressure fore-casting in half an hour on a personal computer.

AB Geological carbon dioxide (CO2) storage (GCS) in saline aquifers has been recognized as a promising way to slow down global CO2 emissions. The residual and solubility trapping efficiency of CO2 saline aquifers play a crucial role in monitoring CO2 sequestration performance. Due to this fact, the goal of this paper is to determine the effectiveness of three robust machine learning (ML) models - a general regression neural network (GRNN) model and two multilayer perceptron (MLP) models respectively optimized with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) and Bayesian Regularization (BR) - in predicting the residual trapping index (RTI) and solubility trapping index (STI) of CO2 in saline aquifers. A comprehensive and wide-ranging dataset was compiled from the literature, including over 1,910 simulation samples from numerous CO2 field models. The predicted results revealed that all the proposed ML techniques have an excellent agreement with simulation data. In addition, the error analyses and a comparison of statistical indicators indicated that the GRNN model was more accurate than the MLP-LMA and MLP-BR models as well as two ML models developed in previous studies. The GRNN model exhibited overall coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.9995 and 0.9998 and average absolute relative error (ARE) percentages of 0.7413% and 0.2950% for RTI and STI, respectively. Furthermore, a trend analysis confirmed the robustness of the GRNN model, as predicted and simulated RTI and STI exhibited strong overlap under four different sets of input parameters. Moreover, the Williams plot reveals that the validity of GRNN model was affirmed, and only a small suspected data was detected from the collected database. Therefore, the GRNN model proposed in this study could serve as a template for evaluating the feasibility of future GCS projects in saline aquifers. Lastly, the findings of this study can help better understanding the promising of machine learning techniques for predicting CO2 trapping efficiency in geological storage sites.

AB The current industrially relevant CO2 capture technologies require high operating and capital costs or are energy-intensive, rendering them inefficient and unsustainable for long-term use. The higher operating cost is primarily due to the energy-intense swing of pH- or temperature-dependent equilibrium of CO32- and HCO3- to capture CO2. CO2 can be captured in an aqueous solution with OH- to convert it into HCO3-, which can be turned back into CO32- and CO2 using either temperature or pH swing. This captured CO2 can be either sequestered or chemically transformed into a usable product. The challenges with this technology are the limited carbon capacity of the aqueous solvent system, higher energy requirement for solvent regeneration, and loss of solvent through evaporation. The water-dependent equilibrium of CO2 with CO32- and HCO3- can be a cost-effective alternative to the existing technologies. Here, we exploit this phenomenon by establishing a water gradient across an anion exchange membrane that separates organic solvent and an aqueous solution. The organic solution contains ethylene glycol saturated with KOH that captures CO2 from dilute sources such as air or flue gas and produces a high concentration of HCO3- that migrates towards the aqueous side, where HCO3- converts back to CO2 for its end-use. The current efficiency of CO2 capture is nearly 100%, with a tunable flux CO2 capture flux that is controlled by the applied current density. The water-dependent CO2 capture and release kinetics are measured using in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and validated using density functional theory. A detailed transport model confirms the CO2 capture, transport, and release mechanism for varying water concentration in the organic solution, membrane thickness, and the applied current. Machine learning model predicts the performance curve for this process that relates CO2 saturation in aqueous solution to the CO2 capture efficiency, relative humidity of flue gas, and current density. The validated prototype of the electrodialysis system showed an unprecedented CO2 capture flux of 2.3 mmol m(-2) s(-1), which is 100 times higher than the state-of-the-art existing CO2 capture technologies. The technoeconomic analysis predicts similar to$145 per ton of CO2 for 1000 ton per hour of CO2 capture capacity.

TI Improving deep learning performance for predicting large-scale geological CO2 sequestration modeling through feature coarsening
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID simulation
AB Physics-based reservoir simulation for fluid flow in porous media is a numerical simulation method to predict the temporal-spatial patterns of state variables (e.g. pressure p) in porous media, and usually requires prohibitively high computational expense due to its non-linearity and the large number of degrees of freedom (DoF). This work describes a deep learning (DL) workflow to predict the pressure evolution as fluid flows in large-scale 3-dimensional(3D) heterogeneous porous media. In particular, we develop an efficient feature coarsening technique to extract the most representative information and perform the training and prediction of DL at the coarse scale, and further recover the resolution at the fine scale by spatial interpolation. We validate the DL approach to predict pressure field against physics-based simulation data for a field-scale 3D geologic CO2 sequestration reservoir model. We evaluate the impact of feature coarsening on DL performance, and observe that the feature coarsening not only decreases the training time by >74% and reduces the memory consumption by >75%, but also maintains temporal error 0.63% on average. Besides, the DL workflow provides predictive efficiency with 1406 times speedup compared to physics-based numerical simulation. The key findings from this research significantly improve the training and prediction efficiency of deep learning model to deal with large-scale heterogeneous reservoir models, and thus it can also be further applied to accelerate workflows of history matching and reservoir optimization for close-loop reservoir management.

AB Mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) based on metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have been extensively studied for carbon capture to combat global warming. Here we report the introduction of machine learning to get more insights. Random forest models are first trained by literature data on CO2/CH4 separation, which reveal the optimum MOF structure with pore size > 1 nm and surface area of 800 m(2) g(-1). Then, representative MOFs are blended into Pebax-2533 and polymer of intrinsic microporosity-1 to fabricate MMMs. The membranes demonstrate CO2 separation performances that not only agree well with model prediction, but also exceed the 2008 Robeson upper bound. In addition, knowledge transfer from CO2/CH4 to CO2/N-2 separations shows better agreement with literature data compared to direct modeling, so it enables fast and resource-saving machine learning. This work applies machine learning to solve domain-specific problems and may provide implications for other membrane development.

AB In this study, an artificial intelligence-based framework was developed to monitor the efficiency of the carbon capture unit, i.e., the Sour Compression Unit (SCU) and a cryogenic unit, in a cement manufacturing plant. Initially, an Aspen Plus-based model of the SCU and the cryogenic unit was developed. The process model was then transformed into dynamic mode through the interfacing of MATLAB and Excel with Aspen Plus to capture real-time process behavior. Five hundred fifty data samples were generated by varying the process conditions, i.e., inlet water flow rate, temperature, pressure, etc. The dataset was then used to develop ensemble models. Output compositions of the models were CO2, SO2, and NO. The ensemble models were used as surrogates in Sobol and Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST) frameworks to find the most sensitive process conditions that affect the efficiency of the process. The correlation coefficients based on the ensemble models for estimation of the composition of CO2, SO2, and NO, were 0.9888, 0.9663, and 0.9970, respectively. Based on the sensitivity analysis, the inlet flue gas temperature and pressure were the dominant variables that affect the mole fraction of SO2 and NO in the flue gas. Besides, the CO2 recovery was found heavily dependent on temperature of the flash tanks. The proposed framework was highly accurate and will provide a base for real-time implementation of the concept of smart factory in cement manufacturing plants.

AB Although renewable-based energy systems have been increasing and attractive worldwide, the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources cannot cause fossil fuels to be completely removed from the energy systems. So, an attractive approach is to capture produced CO2 from existing power plants for several purposes for the status quo. One of these purposes is to use CO2 in greenhouses in the propinquity of power plants. In this context, a greenhouse combined with an absorption chiller and Organic Rankin Cycle was designed and analyzed in order to exert the high temperature exhausted gases enthalpy from the micro power plants. The produced CO2 is also separated using a catalytic converter and is employed for the greenhouse products to compensate for the lack of CO2 for the required standard for plant growth. Compared to similar systems, the present analysis is comprehensive enough in all energy, exergy, economic, and environmental perspectives. Besides, all functions are calculated using a deep artificial neural network algorithm, and two scenarios were considered for both summer and winter. Weather conditions data were collected during a 10-year interval to predict the system's behavior. After optimization, the CO2 production rate was declined by 56% and the maximum energy and exergy efficiencies were achieved by 47.3% and 36.6%, respectively. Also, a net annual interest of 23.4 M$ was achieved due to an increase in greenhouse harvest.

AB Deep saline formations are considered potential sites for geological carbon storage. To better understand the CO2 trapping mechanism in saline aquifers, it is necessary to develop robust tools to evaluate CO2 trapping efficiency. This paper introduces the application of Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) to predict CO2 trapping efficiency in saline formations. First, the uncertainty variables, including geologic parameters, petrophysical properties, and other physical characteristics data, were utilized to create a training dataset. In total, 101 reservoir simulations were then performed, and residual trapping, solubility trapping, and cumulative CO2 injection were analyzed. The predicted results indicated that three machine learning (ML) models that evaluate performance from high to low (GPR, SVM, and RF) can be selected to predict the CO2 trapping efficiency in deep saline formations. The GPR model had an excellent CO2 trapping prediction efficiency with the highest correlation factor (R-2 = 0.992) and the lowest root mean square error (RMSE = 0.00491). Also, the predictive models obtained good agreement between the simulated field and predicted trapping index. These findings indicate that the GPR ML models can support the numerical simulation as a robust predictive tool for estimating the performance of CO2 trapping in the subsurface.

AB To predict CO2 adsorptive capture, as a vital environmental issue, using different zeolites including 5A, 13X, T-Type, SSZ-13, and SAPO-34, different models have been developed by implementing artificial intelligence algorithms. Hybrid adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (Hybrid-ANFIS), particle swarm optimization-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (PSO-ANFIS) and the least-squares support vector machine (LSSVM) modeling optimized with the coupled simulated annealing (CSA) optimization have been employed for the models. The developed models, validated by utilizing various graphical and statistical methods exhibited that the HybridANFIS model estimations for the gas adsorption on 5A, T-Type, SSZ-13, and SAPO-34 zeolites with average absolute relative deviation (AARD) % of 8.21, 1.92, 4.99 and 2.26, and PSO ANFIS model estimations for the gas adsorption on zeolite 13X with an AARD of 4.85% were in good agreement with corresponding experimental data. It could be deduced that the proposed models were more prosperous and efficient in favor of the design and analysis of adsorption processes than previous ones.

AB In this paper, a novel method is proposed for the incorporation of data-driven machine learning techniques into process optimization. Such integration improves the computational time required for calculations during optimization and benefits the online application of advanced control algorithms. The proposed method is illustrated via the chemical absorption-based postcombustion CO2 capture process, which plays an important role in the reduction of CO2 emissions to address climate challenges. These processes simulated in a software environment are typically based on first-principle models and calculate physical properties from basic physical quantities such as mass and temperature. Employing first-principle models usually requires a long computation time, making process optimization and control challenging. To overcome this challenge, in this study, machine learning algorithms are used to simulate the postcombustion CO2 capture process. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and support vector regression (SVR) algorithms are employed to build models for prediction of carbon capture rate (CR) and specific reboiler duty (SRD). The R-2 (a statistical measure that represents the fitness) of these models is, on average, greater than 90% for all the cases. XGBoost and SVR take 0.022 and 0.317 s, respectively, to predict CR and SRD of 1318 cases, whereas the first-principal process simulation model needs 3.15 s to calculate one case. The models built by XGBoost are employed in the optimization methods, such as an agent-based approach represented by the particle swarm optimization and stochastic technique indicated by the simulated annealing, to find specific optimal operating conditions. The most economical case, in which the CR is 72.2% and SRD is 4.3 MJ/kg, is obtained during optimization. The results show that computations with the data-driven models incorporated in the optimization technique are faster than first-principle modeling approaches. Thus, the application of machine learning techniques in the optimization of carbon capture technologies is demonstrated successfully.

AB Carbon capture technologies have been extensively investigated as indispensable tools for reducing CO2 emissions. In particular, CO2 capture using solid waste-derived porous carbons (SWDPCs) has attracted significant research attention as one of the most promising and sustainable approaches to simultaneously mitigate climate change and address solid waste management challenges. Considerable research has recently been conducted on the thermal and chemical treatments of solid waste for upcycling into porous carbons (PCs) for effective and selective CO2 capture. In this review, we discuss the synergistic benefits of employing SWDPCs for CO2 capture and introduce innovative approaches for converting solid waste into PCs with the desired physical and chemical properties. The performance of SWDPCs for CO2 capture is comprehensively discussed in terms of the synthesis route, CO2 capture capacity, process cyclability, and sample optimization guided by machine learning. Furthermore, the mechanisms of CO2 capture on PCs are discussed based on pore structures and incorporated surface functional groups. The life-cycle environmental impact of the PCs synthesized from solid waste and their practical applications for CO2 capture are also evaluated. The overall environmental benefits of the proposed SWDPC-based CO2 capture approach are analyzed in relation to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Furthermore, the remaining challenges in upcycling solid waste into high-performance CO2 adsorbents are discussed, and potential solutions are proposed.

AB Carbon dioxide capture technologies have become a focus to overcome global warming. Biphasic absorbents are one of the promising approaches for energy-saving CO2 capture processes. These biphasic absorbents are mainly composed of a mixed solvent composed of alkanolamine and organic solvents like glycol ether or alcohol. However, screening experiments of the mixed-solvent absorbents are required to search for biphasic absorbents due to their complicated phase behavior. In this work, we developed a prediction method for the phase states of the mixed-solvent absorbents using a quantum calculation and machine learning models, including random forest, logistic regression, and support vector machine models. There are 61 mixed-solvent absorbents containing alkanolamine/glycol ether or alcohol in the dataset. The machine learning models successfully predicted the phase states of the mixed-solvent absorbents before and after CO2 absorption with accuracies of more than 90%. Furthermore, we analyzed the contributions of explanatory variables for prediction using the learned model. As a result, we found that molecular surface charge of the amine species is more important than those of the other organic solvents to determine the phase behaviors during CO2 absorption.

AB We present a framework that couples a high-fidelity compositional reservoir simulator with Bayesian optimization (BO) for injection well scheduling optimization in geological carbon sequestration. This work represents one of the first at tempts to apply BO and high-fidelity physics models to geological carbon storage. The implicit parallel accurate reservoir simulator (IPARS) is utilized to accurately capture the underlying physical processes during CO2 sequestration. IPARS provides a framework for several flow and mechanics models and thus supports both stand-alone and coupled simulations. In this work, we use the compositional flow module to simulate the geological carbon storage process. The compositional flow model, which includes a hysteretic three-phase relative permeability model, accounts for three major CO2 trapping mechanisms: structural trapping, residual gas trapping, and solubility trapping. Furthermore, IPARS is coupled to the International Business Machines (IBM) Corporation Bayesian Optimization Accelerator (BOA) for parallel optimizations of CO2 injection strategies during field-scale CO2 sequestration. BO builds a probabilistic surrogate for the objective function using a Bayesian machine learning algorithm-the Gaussian process regression, and then uses an acquisition function that leverages the uncertainty in the surrogate to decide where to sample. The IBM BOA addresses the three weaknesses of standard BO that limits its scalability in that IBM BOA supports parallel (batch) executions, scales better for high-dimensional problems, and is more robust to initializations. We demonstrate these merits by applying the algorithm in the optimization of the CO2 injection schedule in the Cranfield site in Mississippi, USA, using field data. The optimized injec-tion schedule achieves 16% more gas storage volume and 56% less water/surfactant usage compared with the baseline. The performance of BO is compared with that of a genetic algorithm (GA) and a covariance matrix adaptation (CMA)-evolution strategy (ES). The results demonstrate the superior performance of BO, in that it achieves a competitive objective function value with over 60% fewer forward model evaluations.(c) 2022 THE AUTHORS.

AB Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has attracted strong interest from industry and the scientific community alike due to the ability of storing CO2 in subsurface reservoirs. Deep saline aquifers may be well suited for the safe and long-term storage given their geological structure. The long term underground storage in saline aquifers depends on variety of interrelated trapping mechanisms in addition to the caprock sealing efficiency. Fractures are commonplace in many geological settings and represent a crucial role for hydrocarbon migrations and entrapment. Fracture impact fluid flow in variety of forms, particularly due to the complexity and varying natures of the fractures, which channel the injected CO2 throughout the reservoir formation. This is especially important for tight gas reservoirs and low permeable cap rock structures whose permeability is primarily characterized by the fault and fractures. This outlines the importance of determining accurately fracture penetration in wellbores for CO2 injection. We present a new deep learning framework for the detection of fractures in formation image logs for enhancing CO2 storage. Fractures may represent high velocity gas flow channels which may make CO2 storage a challenge. The novel deep learning framework incorporates both acoustic and electrical formation image logs for the detection of fractures in wellbores for CO2 storage enhancement and injection optimization. The framework was evaluated on the Pohokura-1 well for the detection of fractures, with the framework exhibiting strong classification accuracy. The framework could accurately classify the fractures based on acoustic and electrical image logs in 98.1% for the training and 85.6% for the testing dataset. Furthermore, estimates of the fracture size are strong, indicating the ability of the framework to accurately quantify fracture sizes in order to optimize CO2 injection and storage.

AB The emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) is considered the most acute issue of the 21st century around the globe. Due to this fact, significant efforts have been made to develop rigorous techniques for reducing the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Adsorption of CO2 in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is one of the efficient technologies for mitigating the high levels of emitted CO2. The main aim of this study is to examine the aptitudes of four advanced intelligent models, including multilayer perceptron (MLP) optimized with Levenberg-Marquardt (MLP-LMA) and Bayesian Regularization (MLP-BR), extreme learning machine (ELM), and genetic programming (GP) in predicting CO2 uptake in MOFs. A sufficiently widespread source of data was used from literature, including more than 500 measurements of CO2 uptake in13 MOFs with various pressures at two temperature values. The results showed that the implemented intelligent paradigms provide accurate estimations of CO2 uptake in MOFs. Besides, error analyses and comparison of the prediction performance revealed that the MLP-LMA model outperformed the other intelligent models and the prior paradigms in the literature. Moreover, the MLP-LMA model yielded an overall coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.9998 and average absolute relative deviation (AARD) of 0.9205%. Finally, the trend analysis confirmed the high integrity of the MLP-LMA model in prognosticating CO2 uptake in MOFs, and its predictions overlapped perfectly the measured values with changes in pressure and temperature.

AB We developed two distinct regression models based on machine learning approach for estimating CO2 loading in solvents in this study. The methods of Adaptive boosted support vector (SVR) machines and the Adaptive boosted Gaussian process (GPR) are the models employed in this study for approximating carbon dioxide loading in the solvent for the purpose of environmental applications. Indeed, the case study is molecular separation for capture of CO2 from a mixture using amino acid salt solutions and understanding the influence of variables on variation of gas solubility. The target output parameter in the computations is the CO2 solubility in liquid phase (alpha). The scores of the two models of boosted SVR and boosted GPR were 0.830 and 0.991, respectively, using the R-2 criterion. Furthermore, the error rate with the MAPE standard is 2.21758E-01 and 1.06938E-01 for the two models, respectively. The boosted SVR and regression of the boosted GPR with the MAE criterion have error rates of 1.64937E01 and 7.28501E-02, respectively, as the models' third efficiency metric. The used machine learning models indicated to be robust for simulation of CO2 absorption in liquid phase for environmental applications and can be used to save time and costs of measurements.

AB The geological sequestration of CO2 in deep saline aquifers is one of the most effective strategies to reduce greenhouse emissions from the stationary point sources of CO2. However, it is a complex task to quantify the storage capacity of an aquifer as it is a function of various geological characteristics and operational decisions. This study applies physics-based proxy modeling by using multiple machine learning (ML) models to predict the CO2 trapping scenarios in a deep saline aquifer. A compositional reservoir simulator was used to develop a base case proxy model to simulate the CO2 trapping mechanisms (i.e., residual, solubility, and mineral trapping) for 275 years following a 25-year CO2 injection period in a deep saline aquifer. An expansive dataset comprising 19,800 data points was generated by varying several key geological and decision parameters to simulate multiple iterations of the base case model. The dataset was used to develop, train, and validate four robust ML models-multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB). We analyzed the sequestered CO2 using the ML models by residual, solubility, and mineral trapping mechanisms. Based on the statistical accuracy results, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) value of over 0.999, both RF and XGB had an excellent predictive ability for the cross-validated dataset. The proposed XGB model has the best CO2 trapping performance prediction with R-2 values of 0.99988, 0.99968, and 0.99985 for residual trapping, mineralized trapping, and dissolution trapping mechanisms, respectively. Furthermore, a feature importance analysis for the RF algorithm identified reservoir monitoring time as the most critical feature dictating changes in CO2 trapping performance, while relative permeability hysteresis, permeability, and porosity of the reservoir were some of the key geological parameters. For XGB, however, the importance of uncertain geologic parameters varied based on different trapping mechanisms. The findings from this study show that the physics-based smart proxy models can be used as a robust predictive tool to estimate the sequestration of CO2 in deep saline aquifers with similar reservoir characteristics.

AB We developed an effective U-Net based deep learning (DL) model for inversion of surface gravity data on a rectangular grid to predict 2-D high-resolution subsurface CO2 distribution along a vertical cross-section due to CO2 leakage through a wellbore within a deep CO2 storage reservoir. We used synthetic data to model two types of CO2 leakage scenarios: one CO2 plume in a shallow aquifer (single plume case), and two plumes present at different depths (double plume case). The 3-D synthetic plume samples were created by sampling among predetermined CO2 plume depths, saturations, and volumes. The corresponding surface gravity data on a rectangular grid were generated by a 3-D forward model. The U-Net model detected 72% of single-plume samples, and one or both plumes in 75% of double-plume samples. Most of the undetected single plumes have small gravity field strengths below the typical noise level of 5 mu Gal. This model generated reproducible, reliable predictions with acceptable errors and demonstrated improved spatial resolution over the conventional least-squares inversion. In contrast to the conventional least-squares inversion, which often overestimates the size of its target and underestimates its density, this U-Net model accurately delineated the boundary of a target. Furthermore, this DL inversion detected deep, small, or low saturation CO2 plumes that are often more difficult to resolve with conventional gravity inversion methods. We note the limitations of this feasibility study, including the use of synthetic data with regular CO2 plume shapes, and the prediction of a 2-D plume cross-section rather than the full 3-D plume, as well, we recognize the lower detection fraction for double-plume scenarios. Nevertheless, this study demonstrates that DL gravity inversion is a promising and potentially superior method to conventional least-squares inversion. Our U-Net based deep learning inversion approach may be adapted for inversion of other types of geophysical data. DL inversion can facilitate near real-time monitoring of geologic carbon sequestration to provide site operators with prompt information about subsurface CO2 distribution for risk management and mitigation.

AB In the paper, we present a review of different types of CO2 capture, storage, transportation, and utilization (CCSTU) processes. We have also reviewed their further development by using machine learning (ML) methods. Some examples of carbon capture or separation technologies (CCT) are absorption, adsorption, membranes, chemical looping, pyrogenic carbon capture and storage (PyCCS), hydrates, and mineral sequestration, which we review here. We have also classified hybrid processes where multiple methods can be synergistically used for CO2 capture and utilization. ML methods have also been successfully utilized in CCSTU to enhance the efficiency of CCSTU by process optimization and incorporating new materials design. Based on the review, we have outlined some recommendations for future research, namely consideration of the carbon impact of AI-driven models, and more interactions among ML experts, experimentalists, and computational modelers, which will lead to a holistic approach rather than a competing attitude for rapid commercialization of low-carbon technologies. We also give examples of databases for future research.

AB Efficient CO2 capture from off-gas power plant is attracting increased attention due to its significant effects on global warming and climate change. In this study, three deep learning pipelines (DLPs), namely, Spearman DLP (S-DLP), stepwise backward elimination DLP (SBE-DLP), and Lasso DLP (L-DLP), were developed to predict the CO2 capture potential of amine-based capture processes. Raw operating data, obtained under various conditions in a 0.5 MW MEA demo plant, were used for the DLP, which mainly comprised data gathering and cleaning, feature selection, and deep neural network-based prediction. The outliers, which strongly influence the prediction accuracy, were eliminated from the initial raw data. The clean data was then used to predict the CO2 concentration of treated gas and capture rate using the three DLPs. Based on accuracy and computation cost, LDLP was selected as the best pipeline to predict the CO2 capture rate and CO2 concentration of the treated gas from the 0.5 MW MEA demo plant. The L-DLP was then used to predict the temperature variation in the absorber and stripper, which is a significant control variable to save energy. The deep learning pipeline represents a feasible strategy to predict the CO2 capture potential of the 0.5 MW MEA demo plant, even though the operation of the plant varied from unsteady to steady states under various conditions. The developed pipeline has a great potential for the utilization for other chemical processes with high accuracy in a low computation time.

AB Recently, electrochemical reduction of CO2 into value-added fuels has been noticed as a promising process to decrease CO2 emissions. The development of such technology is strongly depended upon tuning the surface properties of the applied electrocatalysts. Considering the high cost and time-consuming experimental investigations, computational methods, particularly machine learning algorithms, can be the appropriate approach for efficiently screening the metal alloys as the electrocatalysts. In doing so, to represent the surface properties of the electrocatalysts numerically, d-band theory-based electronic features and intrinsic properties obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used as descriptors. Accordingly, a dataset containg 258 data points was extracted from the DFT method to use in machine learning method. The primary purpose of this study is to establish a new model through machine learning methods; namely, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) combined with particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) for the prediction of *CO (the key intermediate) adsorption energy as the efficiency metric. The developed ANFIS-PSO and ANFIS-GA showed excellent performance with RMSE of 0.0411 and 0.0383, respectively, the minimum errors reported so far in this field. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis showed that the center and the filling of the d-band are the most determining parameters for the electrocatalyst surface reactivity. The present study conveniently indicates the potential and value of machine learning in directing the experimental efforts in alloy system electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction.

AB As an extension of our previous research on deep-learning-based adjoint-state approach (Xiao, Deng, & Wang, 2021, ), we present a two-level hybrid neural network architecture to efficiently derive a model-reduced adjoint-based optimization workflow with a large-scale inverse modeling example in geological carbon-storage applications. The first level employs a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique, that is, deep convolutional autoencoder, owing to its high scalability and the availability of high-performance deep-learning libraries for flexible implementation. Analogous to the reduced-order linear model, the second level emulates a neural-network-powered linear transition unit based on the reduced subspace. This hybrid framework provides a readily available model-reduced adjoint derivation with negligible computational cost and computer storage. Once the gradient is obtained in reduced space, it is correspondingly projected back to full space for the inverse modeling. The performance of the method is verified by estimating the space-dependent stochastic permeability field using two geological carbon storage (GCS) process-based multiphase flow models with an increasing complexity. The experimental results indicate that the surrogate model can accurately characterize the spatial-temporal evolution of the CO2 saturation fields using a relatively small number of training data. Although the proposed inversion workflow achieves comparable results similar to the conventional finite-difference method, it is faster than high-fidelity model simulations in several orders of magnitude; hence, it will be a beneficial simulation and modeling tool for engineers to manage the uncertainty of GCS processing.

AB We present deep-learning-based surrogate models for CCUS developed with four different algorithms and a physics-framed two-phase flow problem involving displacement of water by CO2. The deep-learning models were trained using 3D datasets describing the pressure plume, CO2 saturation plume, and water extraction rate generated by numerical simulation. The hyperparameters defining the architecture of the neural networks were optimized to determine the slimmest network size and training parameters that give the most efficient performance at the least training cost. To develop a robust model that closely mimics the governing physical laws, the discretized form of the two-phase fluid transport equation was used to formulate the supervised deep-learning task.The algorithms investigated in this study predicted the data to above 95% accuracy, with the multi-layer perceptron model demonstrating the best performance by balancing training speed, prediction time, and prediction accuracy with lean network capacity. Furthermore, the surrogate models simultaneously predict reservoir pressure and CO2 saturation in every grid block, including the surface well extraction rate and bottomhole pressure, at all simulation times for a given static model realization in just a few seconds on a standard desktop computer. A key outcome of this study is that limits can be placed on network design parameters to avoid over designing neural networks, with associated efficiencies in training and prediction times. This is very useful because large volumes of data may be generated in CCUS projects and over-design of neural network architectures imposes penalties that are antithetical to the goal of near-real time forecasting.

AB An early phase feasibility study was carried out for offshore CO2 capture from ship engines of a CO2 transport ship. A flexible in-house process simulator was applied in the assessments. Parametric studies of the overall onboard process were enabled by a fast data-driven capture plant model derived from supervised machine learning by PLS regression of a large dataset of rigorous simulations. The results show, based on the given models and assumptions, that the thermal energy coming from the ship engine exhaust gas is not sufficient alone to cover the thermal energy demand of an absorption-based CO2 capture unit operating above 50% capture rate using 30 wt% MEA (mono-ethanolamine) as solvent. The thermal energy demand can be met using a fuel afterburner as heat source. The added fuel consumption is estimated to increase the fuel consumption by 6-9% when operating with liquefied natural gas (LNG) as fuel source, while an increase of 8-12% is expected with diesel as fuel source. The effect of absorber height on energy consumption at a given CO2 capture rate is limited, especially for lower capture rates, and may be an important degree of freedom for optimizing the CAPEX/OPEX trade-offs. Use of state-of-the art solvents with lower specific energy consumptions will shift the results towards higher capture rates before a fuel afterburner is required to meet the thermal energy demands.

TI Computational screening methodology identifies effective solvents for CO2 capture

AB Carbon capture and storage technologies are projected to increasingly contribute to cleaner energy transitions by significantly reducing CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-driven power and industrial plants. The industry standard technology for CO2 capture is chemical absorption with aqueous alkanolamines, which are often being mixed with an activator, piperazine, to increase the overall CO2 absorption rate. Inefficiency of the process due to the parasitic energy required for thermal regeneration of the solvent drives the search for new tertiary amines with better kinetics. Improving the efficiency of experimental screening using computational tools is challenging due to the complex nature of chemical absorption. We have developed a novel computational approach that combines kinetic experiments, molecular simulations and machine learning for the in silico screening of hundreds of prospective candidates and identify a class of tertiary amines that absorbs CO2 faster than a typical commercial solvent when mixed with piperazine, which was confirmed experimentally. Amine mixtures are industrially used for carbon capture, whereby sluggish reaction kinetics are sped up with piperazine additives. Here, the authors report an experimentally verified computational approach that combines kinetic experiments, molecular simulations, and machine learning to identify a class of tertiary amines that absorbs CO2 faster than a typical commercial solvent when mixed with piperazine.

AB In this work, we developed artificial intelligence-based models for prediction and correlation of CO2 solubility in amino acid solutions for the purpose of CO2 capture. The models were used to correlate the process parameters to the CO2 loading in the solvent. Indeed, CO2 loading/-solubility in the solvent was considered as the sole model's output. The studied solvent in this work were potassium and sodium-based amino acid salt solutions. For the predictions, we tried three potential models, including Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Tree (DT), and AdaBoostDT. In order to discover the ideal hyperparameters for each model, we ran the method multiple times to find out the best model. R-2 scores for all three models exceeded 0.9 after optimization confirming the great prediction capabilities for all models. AdaBoost-DT indicated the highest R-2 Score of 0.998. With an R-2 of 0.98, Decision Tree was the second most accurate one, followed by MLP with an R-2 of 0.9. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB Designing a model to connect CO2 adsorption data with various adsorbents based on graphene oxide (GO) which is produced from various forms of solid biomass, can be a promising method to develop novel and efficient adsorbents for CO2 adsorption application. In this work, the information of several GO-based solid sorbents were extracted from 17 articles aimed to develop a machine learning based model for CO2 adsorption capacity prediction. The extracted data including specific surface area, pore volume, temperature, and pressure were considered as input parameter, and CO2 uptake capacity was defined as model response, alsoseven different models, including support vector machine, gradient boosting, random forest, artificial neural network (ANN) based on multilayer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF), Extra trees regressor and extreme gradient boosting, were employed to estimate the CO2 adsorption capacity. The best performance was obtained for ANN based on MLP method (R-2>0.99) with hyperparameters of the following: hidden layer size=[45 35 45 45], optimizer=Adam, the learning rate=0.003, beta(1)=0.9, beta(2)=0.999, epochs=1971, and batch size=32. To investigate CO2 uptake dependency on mentioned effective parameters, three dimensional diagrams were reported based on MLP network, also the MLP network characteristics including weight and bias matrices were reported for further application of CO2 adsorption process design. The accurately predicted capability of the generated models may considerably minimize experimental efforts, such as estimating CO2 removal efficiency as the target based on adsorbent properties to pick more efficient adsorbents without increasing processing time. Current work employed statistical analysis and machine learning to support the logical design of porous GO for CO2 separation, aiding in screening adsorbents for cleaner manufacturing.

AB Ionic liquids (ILs) provide a promising solution for CO2 capture and storage to mitigate global warming. However, identifying and designing the high-capacity IL from the giant chemical space require expensive and exhaustive simulations and experiments. Machine learning (ML) can accelerate the process of searching for desirable ionic molecules through accurate and efficient property predictions in a data-driven manner. However, existing descriptors and ML models for the ionic molecule suffer from the inefficient adaptation of molecular graph structure. Besides, few works have investigated the explainability of ML models to help understand the learned features that can guide the design of efficient ionic molecules. In this work, we develop both fingerprint-based ML models and graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict the CO2 absorption in ILs. Fingerprint works on graph structure at the feature extraction stage, while GNNs directly handle molecule structure in both the feature extraction and model prediction stage. We show that our method outperforms previous ML models by reaching a high accuracy (MAE of 0.0137, R2 of 0.9884). Furthermore, we take the advantage of GNN representation and develop a substructure-based explanation method that provides insight into how each chemical fragment within IL molecules contributes to the CO2 absorption prediction of ML models. We also show that our result agrees with some ground truth on functional group importance from the theoretical understanding of CO2 absorption in ILs, which can advise on the design of novel and efficient functional ILs in the future.

AB The CO2 emission issue has triggered the promotion of carbon capture and storage (CCS), particularly bio-route CCS as a sustainable procedure to capture CO2 using biomass-based activated carbon (BAC). The well-known multi-nitrogen functional groups and microstructure features of N-doped BAC adsorbents can synergistically promote CO2 physisorption. Here, machine learning (ML) modeling was applied to the various physicochemical features of N-doped BAC as a challenge to figure out the unrevealed mechanism of CO2 capture. A radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN) was employed to estimate the in operando efficiency of microstructural and N-functionality groups at six conditions of pressures ranging from 0.15 to 1 bar at room and cryogenic temperatures. A diverse training algorithm was applied, in which trainbr illustrated the lowest mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of < 3.5%. RBF-NN estimates the CO2 capture with an R-2 range of 0.97-0.99 of BACs as solid adsorbents. Also, the generalization assessment of RBF-NN observed errors, tolerating 0.5-6% of MAPE in 50-80% of total data sets. An alternative survey sensitivity analysis discloses the importance of multiple features such as specific surface area (SSA), micropore volume (% Vmic), average pore diameter (AVD), and nitrogen content (N%), oxidized-N, and graphitic-N as nitrogen functional groups. A genetic algorithm (GA) optimized the physiochemical properties of N-doped ACs. It proposed the optimal CO2 capture with a value of 9.2 mmol g(-1) at 1 bar and 273 K. The GA coupled with density functional theory (DFT) to optimize the geometries of exemplified BACs and adsorption energies with CO2 molecules.

AB A deep-learning-based surrogate model capable of predicting flow and geomechanical responses in CO2 storage operations is presented and applied. The 3D recurrent R-U-Net model combines deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks to capture the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of 3D saturation and pressure fields and 2D surface displacement maps. The method is trained using high-fidelity simulation results for 2000 storageaquifer realizations characterized by multi-Gaussian porosity and log-permeability fields. Detailed comparisons between surrogate model and full-order simulation results for new storage-aquifer realizations are presented. The saturation, pressure and surface displacement fields provided by the surrogate model display a high degree of accuracy, for both individual realizations and ensemble statistics. The recurrent R-U-Net surrogate model is applied with a rejection sampling procedure for data assimilation. Although the (synthetic) observations consist of only a small number of surface displacement measurements, significant uncertainty reduction in pressure buildup at the caprock is achieved.

AB The design of adsorption systems for separation of CO2/N-2 in carbon capture applications is notoriously challenging because it requires constrained multiobjective optimization to determine appropriate combinations of a moderately large number of system operating parameters. The status quo in the literature is to use the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) to solve the design problem. This approach requires 1000s of timeconsuming process simulations to find the Pareto front of the problem, meaning it can take days of computational time to obtain a solution. As an alternative approach, we have employed a Bayesian optimization algorithm, the Thompson sampling efficient multiobjective optimization (TSEMO). For constrained productivity/energy usage optimization, we find that the TSEMO algorithm is able to find an essentially identical solution to the design problem as that found using NSGA-II, while requiring 14 times less computational time. We have used the TSEMO algorithm to design a postcombustion carbon capture system for a 1000 MW coal fired power plant using two adsorbent materials, zeolite 13X and ZIF-36-FRL. Although ZIF-36-FRL showed promising process-scale performance in previous studies, we find that the industrial scale performance is inferior to the benchmark zeolite 13X, requiring a 21% greater cost per tonne of CO2 captured. Finally, we have also tested the performance of the Bayesian design framework when coupled with a data-driven machine learning process modeling framework. In this instance, we find that the incumbent NSGA-II offers better computational performance than the Bayesian approach by a factor of 3.

AB In past decades, nitrous oxide (N2O), a strong greenhouse gas, has become a serious transdisciplinary issue. As a result, removing N2O utilizing strong green solvents like ionic liquids (ILs) has emerged as a popular method of lowering N2O levels in the environment. The ability to accurately estimate N2O solubility in ILs provides a deeper understanding of the ILs' performance as a solvent for the elimination and management of this hazardous gaseous contaminant in the atmosphere. For the implementation of future IL-based separation procedures at massive scales, reliable calculation of this critical factor is required. The purpose of this research was to develop reliable intelligent networks that can estimate N2O solubility in diverse ILs. To this end, four powerful intelligent models including deep belief network (DBN), categorical boosting algorithm (Cat-Boost), extreme learning machine (ELM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) were developed based on two distinct methods, (I): Chemical structure-based and (II): Thermodynamic properties-based methods. Also, different equations of state (E0Ss) were employed to compare their performance with smart models. The acquired findings indicate that the novel approaches appropriately estimate the solubility of N2O in ILs. Furthermore, the XGB approach was discovered to be the superior forecasting technique in both methods ((I): R-2 = 0.9999 and RMSE = 0.0016, (II): R-2 = 0.9998 and RMSE = 0.0025). The sensitivity analysis of the XGB models revealed that pressure has the greatest effect on the solubility values in both strategies with an absolute relevancy factor value of 0.74, and concerning the chemical structures of ionic liquids, the -SO2 substructure has the greatest effect on N2O solubility with an absolute relevancy factor value of 0.4. In addition, significant superiority of machine learning models over EOSs was observed. Finally, the Leverage approach was used to demonstrate the reliability of the novel paradigm, showing over 96 % of data are into the paradigm's applicability range.
