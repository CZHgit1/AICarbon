AB Simple Summary A combined geothermal heat pump and solar system (GHPS) was installed at a pig house to check the effects on electricity consumption, greenhouse gas emission (GHE), internal farm temperature, the concentration of noxious gases and growth performance. The GHPS heating system reduced energy consumption and CO2 concentrations. Furthermore, the GHPS system effectively maintained the optimum temperature for pig growth inside the pigsty. Additionally, the artificial intelligence (AI)-based model 'gene expression programming (GEP)' was used to predict electricity consumption. This experiment evaluated the performance of a combined geothermal heat pump and solar system (GHPS). A GHPS heating system was installed at a pig house and a comparative study was carried out between the environmentally friendly renewable energy source (GHPS) and the traditional heating method using fossil fuels. The impact of both heating systems on production performance, housing environment, noxious gas emission, and energy efficiency were evaluated along with the GHPS system performance parameters such as the coefficient of performance (COP), inlet and outlet water temperature and efficiency of solar collector. The average temperature inside the pig house was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the GHPS heating system. Similarly, the outflow temperature was increased significantly (p < 0.05) than the inflow temperature. The results of COP and efficiency of the solar system also indicated that the GHPS is an efficient heating system. The electricity consumption and carbon dioxide gas concentration were also reduced (p < 0.05) in the GHPS system. This study also predicts electricity consumption using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based model. The results showed that the proposed model justifies all the acceptance criteria in terms of the correlation coefficient, root mean square value and mean absolute error. The results of our experiment show that the GHPS system can be installed at a pig house for sustainable swine production as a renewable energy source.

TI Machine learning derived dynamic operating reserve requirements in high-renewable power systems
SO JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
ID solar; prediction
AB Accurately forecasting wind and solar power output poses challenges for deeply decarbonized electricity systems. Grid operators must commit resources to provide reserves to ensure reliable operations in the face of forecast errors, a process which can increase fuel consumption and emissions. We apply neural network-based machine learning to expand the usefulness of median point forecast data by creating probabilistic distributions of short-term uncertainty in demand, wind, and solar forecasts that adapt to prevailing grid conditions. Machine learning derived estimates of forecast errors compare favorably to estimates based on incumbent methods. Reserves derived from machine learning are usually smaller than values derived using incumbent methods, which enables fuel savings during most hours. Machine learning reserves are generally larger than incumbent reserves during times of higher forecast error, potentially improving system reliability. Performance is tested using multistage production simulation modeling of the California Independent System Operator system. Machine learning reserves provide production cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions of approximately 0.3% relative to historical 2019 requirements. Savings in the 2030 timeframe are highly dependent on battery storage capacity. At lower levels of battery capacity, savings of 0.4% from machine learning reserves are shown. Significant quantities of battery storage are expected to be added to meet California's resource adequacy needs and GHG reduction targets. The addition of these batteries saturates reserve needs and results in minimal within-hour balancing costs in 2030. Published under an exclusive license by AIP Publishing.

AB Photovoltaic (PV) technology, an efficient solution for mitigating the impacts of climate change, has been increasingly used across the world to replace fossil fuel power to minimize greenhouse gas emissions. With the world's highest cumulative and fastest built PV capacity, China needs to assess the environmental and social impacts of these established PV power plants. However, a comprehensive map regarding the PV power plants' locations and extent remains scarce on the country scale. This study developed a workflow, combining machine learning and visual interpretation methods with big satellite data, to map PV power plants across China. We applied a pixel-based random forest (RF) model to classify the PV power plants from composite images in 2020 with a 30 m spatial resolution on the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The resulting classification map was further improved by a visual interpretation approach. Eventually, we established a map of PV power plants in China by 2020, covering a total area of 2917 km(2). We found that most PV power plants were situated on cropland, followed by barren land and grassland, based on the derived national PV map. In addition, the installation of PV power plants has generally decreased the vegetation cover. This new dataset is expected to be conducive to policy management, environmental assessment, and further classification of PV power plants. The dataset of photovoltaic power plant distribution in China by 2020 is available to the public at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6849477 (Zhang et al., 2022).

AB A primary energy consumption and CO2 emission source stems from buildings and infrastructures due to rapid urbanisation and social development. An accurate method to forecast energy consumption in a building is thus critically needed to enable successful management of adaptive energy consumption and ease the level of CO2 emission. However, energy forecasting for buildings, especially residential buildings, has several challenges, such as significant variations in energy usage patterns due to unpredicted demands of the residences and some intricate factors, which can randomly affect the patterns. Traditional forecasting approaches require a tremendous number of inputs needed for building physic models and variations often exist between as-built and as-designed buildings in reality. Most recent studies have adopted only ambient weather conditions, building components, and the occupant's behaviours. As a result, in order to take into account the complexity of factors that can affect the building energy model development and its computation, we develop advanced machine learning models driven by the inherent electricity consumption pattern associated with the day and time. In this study, we demonstrate benchmarking results derived from three different machine learning algorithms, namely SVR, XGBoost, and LSTM, trained by using 1-year datasets with sub-hourly (30 min) temporal granularity to determine the outperformed predictor. Ultimately, the machine learning model robustness and performance on a basis of the coefficient of variation (CV) obtained by the SVR is benchmarked across XGBoost and LSTM trained by the same datasets containing attributes related to the building type, data size, and temporal granularity. The insight stemming from this study indicates that the suitable choice of the machine learning models for building energy forecasts largely depends on the natural characteristics of building energy data. Hyperparameter tuning or mathematical modification within an algorithm may not be sufficient to attain the most accurate machine learning model for building energy forecast.

AB Greenhouse gas emissions associated with energy consumption in buildings contribute significantly to climate change. In subtropical regions, a well-designed building envelope can effectively reduce the energy demand for space cooling. This study proposes a hybrid simulation approach that can be applied to diverse building types to estimate the annual cooling energy consumption. The proposed model, which is based on Bayesian regularization, demonstrates good generalization ability to predict energy consumption for residential as well as healthcare buildings. In the study, a genetic algorithm was employed to optimize the model parameters for obtaining the minimum or maximum envelope heat gain. It is recommended through this study that by adopting a combination, namely, (i) design parameters resulting in minimum envelope heat gain, (ii) coupling of an air change rate of 9 h-1 and recirculation ratio of 50 %, (iii) lowering lighting power density from 13 W/m2 to 7.3 W/m2, would prove to be an efficient strategy that balances energy and infection control for a general inpatient ward. The proposed generalized hybrid simulation approach can be a helpful tool for building systems engineers to formulate design guidelines or renovation plans to reduce energy consumption and thus greenhouse gas emissions.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB Liquefied natural gas (LNG) gasification coupled with adsorbed natural gas (ANG) charging (LNG-ANG coupling) is an emerging strategy for efficient delivery of natural gas. However, the potential of LNG-ANG to attain the advanced research projects agency-energy (ARPA-E) target for onboard methane storage has not been fully investigated. In this work, large-scale computational screening is performed for 5446 metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and over 193 MOFs whose methane working capacities exceed the target (315 cm(3)(STP) cm(-3)) are identified. Furthermore, structure-performance relationships are realized under the LNG-ANG condition using a machine learning method. Additional molecular dynamics simulations are conducted to investigate the effects of the structural changes during temperature and pressure swings, further narrowing down the materials, and two synthetic targets are identified. The synthesized DUT-23(Cu) and DUT-23(Co) show higher working capacities (approximate to 373 cm(3)(STP) cm(-3)) than that of any other porous material under ANG or LNG-ANG conditions, and excellent stability during cyclic LNG-ANG operation.

AB The emission peak and carbon neutrality targets pose a great challenge to carbon emission reduction in the coal industry, and the coal industry will face an all-around deep adjustment. The forecast of coal price is crucial for reducing carbon emissions in the coal industry in an orderly manner under the premise of ensuring national energy security. The volatility and instability of coal prices are a result of multiple influencing factors, making it very difficult to make accurate predictions of coal price changes. We propose in this paper an innovative hybrid forecasting method (CEEMDAN-GWO-CatBoost) for forecasting coal price indexes by combining machine learning models, feature selections, data decomposition, and model interpretation. By combining high forecasting accuracy with good interpretability, this method fills a gap in the field of coal price forecasting. Initially, we examine the factors that influence coal prices from five angles: Supply, demand, macroeconomic factors, freight costs, and substitutes; and we employ Spearman correlation analysis to reduce the complexity of the attribute set and devise a coal price forecasting index system. Secondly, the CEEMDAN method is used to decompose the raw coal price index data into seven intrinsic modal functions and one residual term in order to weaken the volatility of the data caused by complex factors. Next, the CatBoost model hyperparameters are optimized using the Grey Wolf Optimizer algorithm, while the coal price data is fed into the combined forecasting model. Lastly, the SHAP interpretation method is introduced for studying the important indicators affecting coal prices. The experimental results show that the combined CEEMDAN-GWO-CatBoost forecasting model proposed in this paper has significantly better forecasting performance than other comparative models, and the SHAP method employed in this study identifies the macroeconomic environment, freight costs, and coal import volume as significant factors affecting coal prices. As part of the contribution of this paper, specific recommendations are made to the government regarding the formulation of a regulatory policy for the coal industry in the context of carbon neutrality based on the findings of this research.

AB The employment of solar space heating is a significant measure to achieve carbon neutrality. However, the design of the solar space heating system usually leads to the dilemma of a trade-off between the economic benefit and environmental protection, which cannot be solved by single-objective optimization. In this work, in order to design a solar space heating system of a bungalow equipped with radiant floor heating, multi-objective optimization of the solar collector area and the volume of the water thermal energy storage (TES) tank is performed by coupling TRNSYS simulation, machine learning and genetic algorithm (GA). Simulation for the entire winter operation of the solar space heating system is conducted in TRNSYS, and a database with various combinations of the design variables are generated, based on which an artificial neural network (ANN) is constructed to capture the mapping of the design variables and the system performance indicators. After proper training and validation, the ANN model with satisfactory forecasting precision is utilized as the objective function for optimizing the system. GA is employed for searching the solutions of the multi-objective optimizations. This data-driven approach combining ANN and GA is helpful to achieve the optimal solutions. For the solar space heating system, the CO2 emission reduction can benefit most from the enlargement of the solar collector area and the TES tank volume, while the payback period reaches its minimum when both the solar collector area and the TES tank volume are small. By comparing single-objective with multi-objective optimizations, it is found that the single-objective optimization cannot reveal the interactions among the CO2 emission reduction, annualized life cycle cost (ALCC) and payback period (PBP) and that the optimization focusing on a single objective probably leads to apparent defects and inapplicability in reality. Better balance among the CO2 emission reduction, ALCC and PBP can be achieved from the Pareto optimums of the multi-objective optimization rather than the single-objective optimization. According to the TOPSIS evaluation, the most appropriate design scheme is obtained from the multi-objective optimization and has the potential to reduce the carbon emission by 5480.6 kgCO(2)eq/year while the ALCC and payback period are only 33.40 yen /(m(2) year) and 3.70 years, respectively.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The size and complexity of deep neural networks used in AI applications continue to grow exponentially, significantly increasing energy consumption for training and inference by these models. We introduce an open-source package eco2AI to help data scientists and researchers to track the energy consumption and equivalent CO2 emissions of their models in a straightforward way. In eco2AI we focus on accurate tracking of energy consumption and regional CO2 emissions accounting. We encourage the research for community to search for new optimal Artificial Intelligence (AI) architectures with lower computational cost. The motivation also comes from the concept of AI-based greenhouse gases sequestrating cycle with both Sustainable AI and Green AI pathways.

AB CO2 emission reduction in large-scale pavement network maintenance planning has been an immense concern. The conventional single-objective optimisation modelsoverlook environmental issues such as CO2 emission. However, the introduced multi-objective optimisation aims to enhance the network condition and minimise CO2 emissions simultaneously. Two single-objective (coyote optimisation algorithm and genetic algorithm) and two multi-objective metaheuristic algorithms (multi-objective coyote optimisation algorithm and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm) are employed to assess the effectiveness of the introduced environmental approach. Pavement maintenance planning optimisation requires the deterioration function formula and treatment improvement equation to be modelled. Hence, a new machine learning method called 'differential evolutionary programming' is introduced, which can provide the output-input formula. Differential evolutionary programming predicts the pavement deterioration value and overlay improvement with R-2 of 0.992 and 0.970, respectively. The results indicate that the coyote optimisation algorithm's objective function is 66% lower than that of the genetic algorithm. Likewise, the multi-objective coyote optimisation algorithm reduces the first objective function by 72% on average compared to the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. The grey relational analysis is performed to compare single-objective and multi-objective optimal solutions. All optimal solutions presented by multi-objective modelling dominates the single-objective optimisation optimal solution based on the grey relational grade.

AB The supply of electrical energy is critical to convenient and comfortable living. However, people consume a large amount of energy, contributing to an energy crisis and global warming, and damaging some ecological cycles. Residential electricity consumption has greater elasticity than industrial and business consumption; it therefore has high energy-saving potential. This work establishes an automated platform, which provides information about residential electricity consumption in each city in Taiwan. Machine learning was used to forecast future residential electricity demand. A nature-inspired optimization method was applied to enhance the accuracy of the best machine learner, yielding an even better hybrid ensemble model. Performance measures indicate that the resulting model is accurate and provides effective information for reference. An automatic web-based system based on the model was combined with a web crawler and scheduled to run automatically to provide information on monthly residential electricity consumption in each county and city. By providing energy consumption information across the country, power providers and government can discuss policy and set different goals for energy use. The results of this study can facilitate the early implementation of energy-saving and carbon emission-reducing in cities and aid utility companies in establishing energy conservation guidelines.

AB In the present study, the system is developed to be optimized via artificial intelligence to reduce the environmental impact of the combined energy system based on fuel cells and powered by municipal solid waste as fuel. The municipal solid waste enters the waste treatment plant to prepare to enter the digester. The biogas from the digester is then put into the combined energy system as fuel. The artificial intelligence-based genetic algorithm is proposed to minimize the effect of CO2 emission on the environment. Furthermore, the environmental impact reduction via biogas is compared to that of ordinary systems. The system is modeled regarding technical and economic aspects, and the effect of key design variables is foreseen. Optimization, which is carried out, shows that in the best operation state, the system is capable of producing not only the work of 250 kW but also the second law efficiency, cost rate, and GHG emission of 36.3 %, 22 dollars per hour and 0.93 Ton/MWh, respectively.

AB In order to achieve China's energy conservation and emission reduction goal of peaking carbon dioxide emissions around 2030, it is of great significance. An important means of building energy conservation and emission reduction is the fine management of building energy consumption, which is based on the accurate prediction of building energy consumption, so as to support the optimal management of building operation and achieve the goal of energy conservation and emission reduction. This paper puts forward the evaluation indexes of the results of the building energy consumption prediction model, uses MAPE and RMSE indexes to evaluate the accuracy of the prediction results of the model, and uses the prediction time and input parameter dimensions to evaluate the time cost of the prediction model. Then, using the three building energy consumption prediction models based on machine learning algorithm established above, the prediction of energy consumption of four types of public buildings in different seasons is completed, and the prediction results are evaluated and analyzed. According to the prediction results and the requirements of related work on the accuracy of building energy consumption prediction model, the adaptation relationship between different types of buildings and different machine learning algorithm prediction models is summarized.

AB Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is an imperative of climate policy worldwide. The transport sector accounts for a large proportion of CO2 emissions; therefore, the development of eco-driving has become a critical topic in the study of fuel efficiency and environmental protection. Although considerable research has been carried out on cars, there has been little research involving large vehicles. In this study, second-generation on-board diagnostics (OBD-II) was used to sense and collect the driving data of cars and light-duty buses. These data were then used for predicting real-time fuel consumption by using deep learning methods and a fuel efficiency driving analysis system for both large and small cars. The prediction results demonstrated a correlation coefficient of approximately 90% with actual data and confirmed the applicability of the system to different vehicle types. This system can be integrated with professional driver training centers to improve training quality and promote the development of eco-driving.

AB Green vehicle routing problem (GVRP) aims to consider greenhouse gas emissions reduction, while routing the vehicles. It can be either through adopting Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFVs) or with existing conventional fossil fuel vehicles in fleets. GVRP also takes into account environmental sustainability in transportation and logistics. We critically review several variations and specializations of GVRP to address issues related to charging, pick-up, delivery, and energy consumption. Starting with the concepts and definitions of GVRP, we summarize the key elements and contributors to GVRP publications. Afterward, the issues regarding each category of green vehicle routing are reviewed, based on which key future research directions and challenges are suggested. It was observed that the main focus of previous publications is on the operational level routing decision and not the supply chain issues. The majority of publications used metaheuristic methods, while overlooking the emerging machine learning methods. We envision that in addition to machine learning, reinforcement learning, distributed systems, internet of vehicles (IoV), and new fuel technologies have a strong role in developing the GVRP research further.

AB Production of electricity from the burning of fossil fuels has caused an increase in the emission of greenhouse gases. In the long run, greenhouse gases cause harm to the environment. To reduce these gases, it is important to accurately forecast electricity production, supply and consumption. Forecasting of electricity consumption is, in particular, useful for minimizing problems of overproduction and oversupply of electricity. This research study focuses on forecasting electricity consumption based on time series data using different artificial intelligence and metaheuristic methods. The aim of the study is to determine which model among the artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), least squares support vector machines (LSSVMs) and fuzzy time series (FTS) produces the highest level of accuracy in forecasting electricity consumption. The variables considered in this research include the monthly electricity consumption over the years for different countries. The monthly electricity consumption data for seven countries, namely, Norway, Switzerland, Malaysia, Egypt, Algeria, Bulgaria and Kenya, for 10 years were used in this research. The performance of all of the models was evaluated and compared using error metrics such as the root mean squared error (RMSE), average forecasting error (AFE) and performance parameter (PP). The differences in the results obtained via the different methods are analyzed and discussed, and it is shown that the different models performed better for different countries in different forecasting periods. Overall, it was found that the FTS model performed the best for most of the countries studied compared to the other three models. The research results can allow electricity management companies to have better strategic planning when deciding on the optimal levels of electricity production and supply, with the overall aim of preventing surpluses or shortages in the electricity supply.

AB This study aims to develop uncertainty energy planning of net-zero energy communities with innovative peer-topeer energy trading management and advanced green vehicle storage considering climate changes by 2050 with transient system modelling, stochastic uncertainty sampling and data-driven machine learning predictions. The future-oriented peer-to-peer energy trading management strategy is proposed considering large renewable energy generation in determining time-of-use power periods to improve energy flexibility. The aleatory and epistemic uncertainties of key weather parameters determining renewables generation with climate changes are quantified and various machine learning regression models are used to predict dynamic solar photovoltaic and wind power generation by 2050 with weather uncertainty. The study results indicate that the ambient temperature increases with time at the uncertainty range of [0, 17.82%], the beam radiation , sky diffuse radiation decrease with time at [-24.86%, 0] , the ground reflected diffuse radiation and wind speed show an uncertain trend at [-0.72%, 0.72%]. The annual solar photovoltaic and wind power generation in 2050 is projected to be 11.69% and 0.61% lower than those of the typical meteorological year. The peer trading cost saving in 2050 considering climate changes is reduced by 2.25% and the annual equivalent carbon emissions are increased by 9.15% compared with the typical meteorological year scenario. The uncertainty design of net-zero energy communities integrated with hydrogen vehicle and battery vehicle storage considering climate changes provides significant guidance for advancing net zero carbon and realizing carbon neutrality for integrated building and transport sectors by 2050.

AB Smart buildings that utilize innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the internet of things (IoT), and cloud computing to improve comfort and reduce energy waste are gaining popularity. Smart buildings comprise a range of sensors to measure real-time indoor environment variables essential for the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system control strategies. For accuracy and smooth operation, current HVAC system control strategies require multiple sensors to capture the indoor environment variables. However, using too many sensors creates an extensive network that is costly and complex to maintain. Our proposed research solves the mentioned problem by implementing a machine-learning algorithm to estimate unmeasured variables utilizing a limited number of sensors. Using a six-month data set collected from a three-story smart building in Japan, several extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models were designed and trained to estimate unmeasured room temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 concentrations. Our models accurately estimated temperature, humidity, and CO2 concentration under various case studies with an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.3 degrees, 2.6%, and 26.25 ppm, respectively. Obtained results show an accurate estimation of indoor environment measurements that is applicable for optimal HVAC system control in smart buildings with a reduced number of required sensors.

AB The expansion of online services, the advent of big data, and the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology have led to an exponential growth in the number of data centers (DC). Within this new digital systems, DCs are the keystone. This poses major environmental problems through high energy consumption. The energy consumption growth of the DC's systems are expected to account for 3.2% of global carbon emissions by 2025. This remarkable growth in the energy consumption of DCs represents today a major challenge for energy efficiency. To meet these challenges, Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) can be used to measure and optimize DC energy efficiency. Thus, accurate PUE prediction is challenging. Moreover, the non-linearity of the different DCs subsystems interactions and their inter-dependencies make the prediction of PUE more difficult since it is affected by complex factors such as workload variation, in addition to weather conditions and humidity, etc.In this paper, we present three machine learning models, MLP, Resilient Backpropagation-based DNN and Attention-based LSTM, to predict PUE values. The performance of these models has been evaluated using two datasets gathered from two case studies of real DCs. For both DC cases, experimental results showed that the attention-based LSTM model outperforms resilient backpropagation-based DNN and MLP models in terms of prediction errors and PUE.

The building infrastructure sector is one of the largest global consumers of electricity and thereby one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing building energy consumption directly contributes to achieving energy sustainability, emissions reduction, and addressing the challenges of a warming planet, while also supporting the rapid urbanization of human society. Energy Conservation Measures (ECM) that are digitalized using advanced sensor technologies are a formal approach that is widely adopted to reduce the energy consumption of building infrastructure. Measurement and Verification (M&V) protocols are a repeatable and transparent methodology to evaluate and formally report on energy savings. As savings cannot be directly measured, they are determined by comparing pre-retrofit and post-retrofit usage of an ECM initiative. Given the computational nature of M&V, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can be leveraged to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and consistency of M&V protocols. However, AI has been limited to a singular performance metric based on default parameters in recent M&V research. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a comprehensive AI approach for M&V protocols in energy-efficient infrastructure. The novelty of the framework lies in its use of all relevant data (pre and post-ECM) to build robust and explainable predictive AI models for energy savings estimation. The framework was implemented and evaluated in a multi-campus tertiary education institution setting, comprising 200 buildings of diverse sensor technologies and operational functions. The results of this empirical evaluation confirm the validity and contribution of the proposed framework for robust and explainable M&V for energy-efficient building infrastructure and net zero carbon emissions.

AB Buildings are currently among the largest consumers of electrical energy with considerable increases in CO2 emissions in recent years. Although there have been notable advances in energy efficiency, buildings still have great untapped savings potential. Within demand-side management, some tools have helped improve electricity consumption, such as energy forecast models. However, because most forecasting models are not focused on updating based on the changing nature of buildings, they do not help exploit the savings potential of buildings. Considering the aforementioned, the objective of this article is to analyze the integration of methods that can help forecasting models to better adapt to the changes that occur in the behavior of buildings, ensuring that these can be used as tools to enhance savings in buildings. For this study, active and passive change detection methods were considered to be integrators in the decision tree and deep learning models. The results show that constant retraining for the decision tree models, integrating change detection methods, helped them to better adapt to changes in the whole building's electrical consumption. However, for deep learning models, this was not the case, as constant retraining with small volumes of data only worsened their performance. These results may lead to the option of using tree decision models in buildings where electricity consumption is constantly changing.

AB Heavy industries such as oil & gas, steel & iron production, the cement industry, chemical processes, and pulp & paper mills are among the industries that contribute most to greenhouse gas emissions. The operation of processes in these industries requires massive amounts of energy, which is mainly generated through the consumption of natural resources, leading to the emission of harmful gases. These emissions can be reduced by improving the efficiency of process operations and with better management of abnormal events/faults through accurate fault classification. Managers and operators of these industries need intelligent fault classification strategies that provide accurate information and decisions on faulty situations management, thus helping day-to-day processes operate in safe, reliable and energy-efficient ways. This paper proposes a decision fusion approach that combines outputs produced by diversified machine learning fault classifiers, each with distinct pattern representations. The proposed approach mainly adopts the behavior knowledge space (BKS) method and updates the corresponding lookup table based on the F1-scores calculated for every single fault classifier based on historical data. The concept is based on the exploitation of the advantages of each fault classifier as a complementary information source to effectively classify faults and provide plant operators and engineers with unified, accurate and comprehensive decisions. The proposed approach is validated through two case studies in the pulp and paper industry. The first one is the pulp mill process benchmark using simulated data and the second case is on a reboiler in a Canadian thermomechanical pulp mill. The results obtained demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed approach is higher than the accuracy of every single classifier and other comparable methods applied to such complex industrial processes. The results have helped the mill operators correctly identify the causes of abnormal events and have contributed to significant energy savings and reduction in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.

AB The legacy grid is developing into an intelligently rooted grid system that can enhance and adapt its performance to learning experiences in its architectural components. Due to the evolution of artificial intelligence and in-depth learning techniques, decision-making and execution can become autonomous activities in intelligent power grids throughout the years. 3D visualization plays a vital role in simplifying monitoring, analysis, and reaction to events in the smart grid. The visualization of the 3D models for various energy system applications is first summarized, including the smart grid, power vehicles, and energy consumption of buildings. Accordingly, design principles are provided for wide-screen, personal computer, or mobile interfaces. Visualization technology for geographical information systems is described. 3D technology, animations, and AR&VR to visualize the energy system is discussed. In this article, a coherent 3D visualization approach for the control and monitoring of intelligent power grids (P.G.) via the deep learning (DL) method is examined in industry literature (3D-PGDL). Data visualization is gaining significance with improved measurement systems and Big Data Analytics in intelligent grids and low carbon energy systems. No data design study, accompanying technology, or visualization tools have been conducted. The analysis and practice of data viewing on energy and power systems are thoroughly addressed here. Because of the intrinsic properties of intelligent grids, all collected and processed data are heterogeneous to provide a more comprehensive, multifaceted control viewpoint for the energy sector by creating new ICT instruments and platforms. This section's experiment resulted in a 95.3 % prediction rate and improved data management ratio of 95.7 %, a lower energy consumption ratio of 18.2%, a lower probability of 18.4 %, a lower CO2 emission level of 15.6 % and a humidity rate of 93.1 %.

AB Assessing the energy performance of existing residential buildings (ERB) has been identified as key to improving building energy efficiency and reducing associated greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. However, identifying optimal retrofit packages requires a significant amount of knowledge of building energy modelling, and it is a time-consuming and laborious process. This paper proposed a data-driven framework that combines machine learning, multi-objective optimization, and multi-criteria decision-making techniques to evaluate the energy performance of ERB and thereby formulate optimal retrofit plans. First, an artificial neural network (ANN) was developed to predict the energy performance of a wide range of retrofit packages. A genetic algorithm was employed to determine the best structure and hyperparameters of the ANN model. Then, the energy consumption results were integrated with environmental and economic impact data to evaluate the environmental and economic performance of retrofit packages and thereby identify Pareto optimal solutions. Finally, a multi-criteria decision-making method was used to select the best retrofit packages among the optimal solutions. The proposed framework was validated using data on a typical residential building in British Columbia, Canada. The results indicated that this framework could effectively predict building energy performance and help decision-makers to make an optimal decision when choosing retrofit packages.

AB One of the largest sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is the construction concrete industry which has alone 50% of the world's emissions. One possible remedy to mitigate the effect of environmental issues is the use of waste and recycled material in concrete. Today, immense agricultural waste is being used as a substitute for cement in the production of sustainable concrete. Therefore, this study is aimed to predict and develop an empirical formula of the compressive strength of rice husk ash (RHA) concrete using machine learning algorithms. Methods employed in this study includes gene expression programming (GEP) and Random Forest Regression (RFR). A reliable database of 192 data points was employed for developing the models. Most influential variables including age, cement, rice husk ash, water, super plasticizer, and aggregate were employed as input parameters in the development of RHA-based concrete models. Evaluation of models was performed using different statistical parameters. These statistical measures include mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R-2), performance index (rho), root man square error (RMSE), relative squared error (RSE) and relative root mean square (RRMSE). The GEP model outperforms the RFR ensemble model in terms of robustness, with a greater correlation of R-2 = 0.96 compared to RFR's R-2 = 0.91. Ensemble modeling showed an enhancement of 1.62 percent for RFR compressive strength model when compared with individual RFR compressive strength model as illustrated by statistical parameters. Moreover, GEP model shows an enhancement of 37.33 percent in average error with an average error 2.35 MPa as compared to RFR model with average error of about 3.75 MPa. Cross validation was used as external check to avoid overfitting issues of the models and confirm the generalized model output. Parametric analysis was performed to determine the impact of the input parameters on the output. Cement and age were shown to have a substantial impact on the compressive strength of RHA concrete using sensitivity analysis.

AB With the increase in electricity supply from clean energy sources, electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) has received increasing attention as an alternative source of carbon-based fuels. As CO2 reduction is becoming a stronger alternative for the clean production of chemicals, the need to model, optimize and control the electrochemical reduction of the CO2 process becomes inevitable. However, on one hand, a first-principles model to represent the electrochemical CO2 reduction has not been fully developed yet because of the complexity of its reaction mechanism, which makes it challenging to de-fine a precise state-space model for the control system. On the other hand, the unavailability of efficient concentration measurement sensors continues to challenge our ability to develop feedback control systems. Gas chromatography (GC) is the most common equipment for monitoring the gas product composition, but it requires a period of time to analyze the sample, which means that GC can provide only delayed measurements during the operation. Moreover, the electrochemical CO2 reduction process is catalyzed by a fast -deactivating copper catalyst and undergoes a selectivity shift from the product-of-interest at the later stages of experiments, which can pose a challenge for conventional control methods. To this end, machine learning (ML) techniques provide a potential approach to overcome those difficulties due to their demonstrated ability to capture the dynamic behavior of a chemical process from data. Motivated by the above considerations, we propose a machine learning-based modeling methodology that integrates support vector regression and first-principles modeling to capture the dynamic behavior of an experimental electrochemical reactor; this model, together with limited gas chromatography measurements, is employed to predict the evolution of gas-phase ethylene concentration. The model prediction is directly used in a proportional-integral (PI) controller that manipulates the applied potential to regulate the gas-phase ethylene concentration at energy-optimal set-point values computed by a real-time process optimizer (RTO). Specifically, the RTO calculates the operation set-point by solving an optimization problem to maximize the economic benefit of the reactor. Lastly, suitable compensation methods are introduced to further account for the experimental uncertainties and handle catalyst deactivation. The proposed modeling, optimization, and control approaches are the first demonstration of active control for a CO2 electrolyzer and contribute to the automation and scale-up efforts for electrified manufacturing of fuels and chemicals starting from CO2.

AB While developing technology and industrialization factors increase production, they also lead to an increase in energy consumption at the same time. The transportation sector, which is a branch of industrialization, has an important place on the basis of sector in energy consumption. In this study, energy consumption in the transportation sector has been examined, especially in the USA, where freight transport by road has an important place, it has a high potential. Within the scope of the study, energy consumption prediction modeling is made by using artificial neural networks (ANN) adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and Simple Membership Functions and Fuzzy Rules Generation Technique (Fuzzy SMRGT) from artificial intelligence techniques. Artificial intelligence methods were also compared with multivariate linear regressions and multivariate regressions types. Interaction, pure quadratic and quadratic methods were used as multiple nonlinear regression. In the modeling, energy consumption was estimated by taking the highway network length, the number of vehicles and the number of drivers as independent variables. When comparing the prediction models, the determination coefficient (R-2), the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the average percentage error (APE) performance criteria were taken into consideration. In addition, it was shown that the models performed well based on the metrics in the testing phase. When the performances of the models were compared, it was seen that two models obtained remarkable results. According to performance criteria, the best model is obtained by Fuzzy SMRGT and ANFIS methods. R-2, RMSE, APE values of the best models are Fuzzy SMRGT (0,978; 208,08; % 0,79) and ANFIS (0,969; 282,69; % 1,06), respectively. The Fuzzy SMGRT and ANFIS models have slightly better performance than MLR, MR, ANN models. It is aimed to use the developed models in the evaluation and management of transportation and energy policies.

AB Data centers are experiencing unprecedented growth as the fourth industrial revolution's supporting pillars and the engine for the future digitalized world. However, data centers are carbon-intensive enterprises due to their massive energy consumption, and it is estimated that data center industry will account for 8% of global carbon emissions by 2030. Meanwhile, both technological and policy instruments for reducing or even neutralizing data center carbon emissions have not been thoroughly investigated, despite the fact that several global cloud providers including Google and Facebook, have pledged to achieve carbon neutrality in their hyperscale data centers. To bridge this gap, this survey paper proposes a roadmap towards carbon-neutral data centers that takes into account both policy instruments and technological methodologies. We begin by presenting the carbon footprint of data centers, as well as some insights into the major sources of carbon emissions. Following that, carbon neutrality plans for major global cloud providers are discussed to summarize current industrial efforts in this direction. In what follows, we introduce the carbon market as a policy instrument to explain how to offset data center carbon emissions in a cost-efficient manner. On the technological front, we propose achieving carbon-neutral data centers by increasing renewable energy penetration, improving energy efficiency, and boosting energy circulation simultaneously. A comprehensive review of existing technologies on these three topics is elaborated subsequently. Based on this, a multi-pronged approach towards carbon neutrality is envisioned and a digital twin-powered industrial artificial intelligence (AI) framework is proposed to make this solution a reality. Furthermore, three key scientific challenges for putting such a framework in place are discussed. Finally, several applications for this framework are presented to demonstrate its enormous potential.

AB To meet the energy demand in a sustainable way, fossil fuels must be substituted with alternative resources and technologies. This transformation is encouraged to reduce greenhouse gases using environmental-friendly practices. Although our country is rich in biomass resources due to climate, land conditions, agriculture and animal husbandry activities, the installed power is quite below its potential. Focusing on this point, the aim of this study is to propose a forecasting method that determines the quantities, distributions, production amounts, waste amounts and energy potential of various biomass resources consistently. The integrated method used in the solution utilizes statistical data and consists of artificial intelligence and geographic information systems. First of all, various bioenergy sources that can be used as energy resources have been determined, and the amount, yield, and energy potential of animal and agricultural wastes expected to occur in the following years have been estimated using an artificial intelligence-based method, support vector regression. Then, spatial analysis has been carried out using geographic information systems, and the distribution of existing and possible agricultural lands has been determined. Finally, the amount of energy that can be obtained using wastes from different biomass sources under various scenarios has been calculated and solutions have been compared. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first proposing an integrated method consisting of support vector regression and geographic information systems to forecast the biomass-based energy potential in Turkey. The integrated method was applied to Acipayam district in Denizli. Among the various scenario approaches, the cultivation of rapeseed (canola) plants on non-utilized arable land and the use of its wastes in bioenergy production have been found to yield the highest energy potential. The results showed that approximately 29,2%, 27,8%, and 27,6% energy increase could be obtained from agricultural residues of rapeseed in the next three years if it was planted on the quarter of the idle land. Besides, under this scenario, the total annual electricity demand of 6972, 6663 and 6545 houses could be met from agricultural residues in a sustainable and clean manner. The proposed method can be applied to different regions, various biomass resources and used to make strategic decisions in this field. (c) 2021 Karabuk University.

AB Recently, several countries have focused on industrial decarbonization to ensure that the net emissions of carbon dioxide reach zero and contribute to decreasing the global mean temperature. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of a net-zero carbon roadmap for the petrochemical industry by 1) developing an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based generative model to produce stochastic scenarios for offshore wind power in an elec-trical grid, and 2) conducting techno-economic and environmental assessments for forecasting models that define offshore wind power networks. Firstly, data processing techniques were utilized on remotely sensed offshore wind speed datasets and energy data obtained from petrochemical industrial parks. Second, a generative model was designed using a variational autoencoder (VAE) to produce different forecast scenarios of offshore wind power. Third, stochastic scenarios were developed by considering behavioral characteristics of offshore wind power with stochastic scenario uncertainties. Finally, we investigated the techno-economic and environmental assessments of the proposed renewable energy networks. Comparing to the case of offshore wind power in 2022, The proposed XAI-driven net-zero carbon roadmap indicated that the total cost of electricity generation and fossil fuel cost with carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be reduced by 4% and 42% with 41% reduction of CO2 emission. Ultimately, this may be implemented in industrial parks to aid in efforts towards carbon neutrality.

AB With the advancement of information and communication technologies (ICTs), there has been high-scale utilization of IoT and adoption of AI in the transportation system to improve the utilization of energy, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, increase quality of services, and provide many extensive benefits to the commuters and transportation authorities. In this article, we propose a novel edge-based AI-IoT integrated energy-efficient intelligent transport system for smart cities by using a distributed multi-agent system. An urban area is divided into multiple regions, and each region is sub-divided into a finite number of zones. At each zone an optimal number of RSUs are installed along with the edge computing devices. The MAS deployed at each RSU collects a huge volume of data from the various sensors, devices, and infrastructures. The edge computing device uses the collected raw data from the MAS to process, analyze, and predict. The predicted information will be shared with the neighborhood RSUs, vehicles, and cloud by using MAS with the help of IoT. The predicted information can be used by freight vehicles to maintain smooth and steady movement, which results in reduction in GHG emissions and energy consumption, and finally improves the freight vehicles' mileage by reducing traffic congestion in the urban areas. We have exhaustively carried out the simulation results and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed system.

AB Searching for a free parking space can lead to traffic congestion, increasing fuel consumption, and greenhouse gas pollution in urban areas. With an efficient parking infrastructure, the cities can reduce carbon emissions caused by additional fuel combustion, waiting time, and traffic congestion while looking for a free parking slot. A potential solution to mitigating parking search is the provision of parking-related data and prediction. Previously many external data sources have been considered in prediction models; however, the underlying impact of contextual data points and prediction has not received due attention. In this work, we integrated parking occupancy, pedestrian, weather, and traffic data to analyze the impact of external factors on on-street parking prediction. A comparative analysis of well-known Machine (ML) Learning and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), Decision Trees (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GA), Adaptive Boosting (AB), and linear SVC for the prediction of OnStreet parking space availability has been conducted. The results show that RF outperformed other techniques evaluated with an average accuracy of 81% and an AUC of 0.18. The comparative analysis shows that less complex algorithms like RF, DT, and KNN outperform complex algorithms like MLP in terms of prediction accuracy. All four data sources have positively impacted the prediction, and the proposed solution can determine the best possible parking slot based on weather conditions, traffic flow, and pedestrian volume. The experiments on live prediction showed an ingest rate of 0.1 and throughput of 0.3 events per second, demonstrating a fast and reliable prediction approach for available slots within a 5-10 min time frame. The study is scalable for larger time frames and faster predictions that can be implemented for IoT-based big data-driven environments for on-street and off-street parking.

AB The global building sector is responsible for nearly 40% of total carbon emissions, offering great potential to move closer to set climate goals. Energy performance certificates designed to increase the energy efficiency of buildings require accurate predictions of building energy performance. With significant advances in information and communication technology, data-driven methods have been introduced into building energy performance research demonstrating high computational efficiency and prediction performance. However, most studies focus on prediction performance without considering the potential of explainable artificial intelligence. To bridge this gap, the novel QLattice algorithm, designed to satisfy both aspects, is applied to a dataset of over 25,000 German residential buildings for predicting annual building energy performance. The prediction performance, compu-tation time, and explainability of the QLattice is compared to the established machine learning algorithms artificial neural network, support vector regression, extreme gradient boosting, and multiple-linear regression in a case study, variable importance analyzed, and appropriate applications proposed. The results show quite strongly that the QLattice should be further considered in the research of energy performance certificates and may be a potential alternative to established machine learning algorithms for other prediction tasks in energy research.

AB In the field of materials science, the main objective of predictive models is to provide scientists with reliable tools for fast and accurate identification of new materials with exceptional properties. Over the last few years, machine learning methods have been extensively used for the study of the gas-adsorption in nanoporous materials as an efficient alternative of molecular simulations and experiments. In several cases, the accuracy of the constructed predictive models for unknown materials is extremely high. In this study, we explored the adsorption of methane by metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and concluded that many top-performing materials often deviate significantly from the known materials used for the training of the machine learning algorithms. In such cases, the predictions of the machine learning algorithms may not be adequately accurate. For lack of the required appropriate data, we put forth a simple approach for the construction of artificial MOFs with the desired superior properties. Incorporation of such data during the training phase of the machine learning algorithms improves the predictions outstandingly. In some cases, over 96% of the unknown top-performing materials are successfully identified.

TI Marine route optimization using reinforcement learning approach to reduce fuel consumption and consequently minimize CO2 emissions

AB To meet the 2050 CO2 targets, the shipping industry which is responsible for about 3% of global CO2 emissions needs to be optimized in several aspects. Obviously, alternative fuels constitute the main measure in this respect. However, relatively high fuel prices in combination with increasing political and economic pressure may raise the need for more efficient ship operation. Ship route optimization can make an indispensable contribution to achieving this goal. In this sense, this paper applies an innovative approach for route optimization using Reinforcement Learning (RL). For this purpose, a generic ship model is first developed using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to predict the fuel consumption of the ship. Moreover, various RL methods, namely Deep QNetwork (DQN), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are applied. The application of RL enables continuous action space and simultaneous optimization of ship speed and heading. DDPG demonstrates the best results as an off-policy and policy gradient method which allows a continuous action space. For example, in the fuel consumption minimization scenario without time limitation, this method can achieve savings of 6.64%. For DQN as a method with discrete action space, this value is 1.07%.

AB Driven by the information technology revolution, using artificial intelligence to promote intelligent manufacturing while achieving carbon emissions reduction is increasingly the focus of international attention. Given this, based on the fact that China's industrial manufacturing is more intelligent, this paper uses industrial sector data and robot data from 2000 to 2017 to examine the impact of intelligent manufacturing on industrial carbon dioxide emissions and to discuss its internal mechanism. The research found that intelligent manufacturing significantly inhibits carbon dioxide emissions in the industrial sectors. The emission reduction effect is more obvious in industries with higher carbon emissions and intelligence. The mechanism test shows that intelligent manufacturing mainly achieves industrial emission reduction by reducing fossil energy consumption in the production process and improving energy use efficiency. The research findings of this paper provide favorable evidence for using new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, to achieve carbon emissions reduction, and validate the importance of intelligent manufacturing in tackling climate change in the future. It provides an essential reference for developing countries to use artificial intelligence for their carbon emissions reduction goals.

AB Renewable microgrid (RMG) is a new solution to improve the safety, reliability, quality, and performance of energy in electrical systems. By implementing different renewable energy sources, like photovoltaic panels and wind turbines, RMGs can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance proficiency. The paper suggests a RMG energy management method based on machine learning, which considers a reconfigurable frame according to the remote link switching and segmentation. The proposed scheme investigates advanced support vector machines to model and estimates the charging demand (ChD) of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). To reduce the load impact of HEV on the network, 2 various cases have been implemented; one is coordinated, and the other is smartly charged. Because of the complex construction of the problem statement, an improved optimization technique according to the gray wolf is proposed. The simulation outcomes of the IEEE microgrid (MG) trial system depict that it is of adequate and efficient quality in both cases. Based on the result of the forecast for the total charge demand of HEVs, the average absolute percentage error is 0.978 that is so small. Furthermore, the outcomes are shown that, compared to the coordination scheme, the total operating cost of the MG in smart load is reduced by 2.5%.

AB Achieving carbon neutrality has been one of the main tasks these decades. In this study, renewable energies were introduced to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of industrial energy systems. Considering solar heat and wind energy uncertainties, a data-driven stochastic robust optimization framework was proposed. Machine learning methods were applied to derive data information: a data mining method to classify the high-volume uncertain data; a kernel-based method to construct the uncertainty sets for each data class. The stochastic robust optimization model of the industrial energy system was developed as a bilevel optimization procedure: the outer level is a two-stage stochastic programming problem to optimize the expected objective value of different data clusters, and the robust optimization is nested internally to ensure robustness. A case study on the practical industrial energy system was performed, and the results are that the total annual cost is reduced by 1 507 730 $/a and 7.62% GHG emissions are decreased by introducing renewable energies; the proposed method is superior to the traditional ones in terms of PoR (2.91%) and robustness (99.79%). The results of multiobjective optimization considering economic and environmental revenues can provide multipreference schemes for decision-makers.

AB A large power generation facility is a complex multi-criteria system associated with multivariate couplings, high dependency, and non-linearity among the operating variables which present a major challenge to ensure efficient power production. In this research, an integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and response surface methodology (AI-RSM) framework to achieve the efficient power production operation of a 660 MW coal power plant is presented. Two AI algorithms, i.e., extreme learning machine (ELM) and support vector machine (SVM) are trained comprehensively on the power plant's operational data and are validated as well. Full factorial design of experiments on the three levels of the operating parameters are constructed and simulated from the better performing AI model which is an effective non-linear representation of the complex power plant operation. RSM analysis is carried out under three power generation scenarios to simulate the effective values of the operating variables which are tested on the power plant's operation and a reasonable agreement is found with the experimental observations. The notable improvement in fuel consumption rate, thermal efficiency, and heat rate of the power plant under Half Load, Mid Load, and Full Load capacity of the power plant is achieved by the AI-RSM framework enabled analyses. It is estimated that annual reduction in CO2, CH4 and Hg emissions measuring 210 kg tons per year (kt/y), 23.8 t/y and 2.7 kg/y, respectively can be obtained corresponding to Mid Load operating state of the power plant. The research presents the reliable and robust utilization of AI-RSM framework for simulating the effective operating conditions for the fossil-based power plants' operation with an eventual goal to improve the techno-environmental performance which is expected to contribute to net-zero emissions goal from the energy sector.

AB Airline industry has witnessed a tremendous growth in the recent past. Percentage of people choosing air travel as first choice to commute is continuously increasing. Highly demanding and congested air routes are resulting in inadvertent delays, additional fuel consumption and high emission of greenhouse gases. Trajectory planning involves creation identification of cost-effective flight plans for optimal utilization of fuel and time. This situation warrants the need of an intelligent system for dynamic planning of optimized flight trajectories with least human intervention required. In this paper, an algorithm for dynamic planning of optimized flight trajectories has been proposed. The proposed algorithm divides the airspace into four dimensional cubes and calculate a dynamic score for each cube to cumulatively represent estimated weather, aerodynamic drag and air traffic within that virtual cube. There are several constraints like simultaneous flight separation rules, weather conditions like air temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed and direction that pose a real challenge for calculating optimal flight trajectories. To validate the proposed methodology, a case analysis was undertaken within Indian airspace. The flight routes were simulated for four different air routes within Indian airspace. The experiment results observed a seven percent reduction in drag values on the predicted path, hence indicates reduction in carbon footprint and better fuel economy.

AB Forecasting energy demand in emerging nations is a critical policy tool utilized by decision makers worldwide. However, as estimated economic and demographic characteristics frequently diverge from realizations, precise forecast results are difficult to get due to the economic system's intrinsic complexity. This work proposed a machine learning model for estimating energy consumption in China using the support vector regression model (SVR). Additionally, Markov Chain (MC) is employed to forecast and analyze the evolving energy consumption structure. The results demonstrate that SVR model is more accurate (98.4%) than the linear model (Moving Average model), the nonlinear model (Grey model), and past research in predicting energy usage. Under the current rate of energy consumption, China's total energy consumption will break through six billion in the next 4 years. Furthermore, it is expected that China's energy consumption structure will be more rational in 2025, with increased non-fossil energy consumption and decreased coal consumption, while natural gas consumption continues to grow at a low rate. It provides scientific basis for the implementation of carbon emission peak action, energy security and energy development plan during the 14th Five-Year Plan period.

AB In this research, an integrated energy system for providing triple loads of an educational building has been modeled, analyzed, and optimized using artificial intelligence The use of different load supply patterns for the integrated system was optimized and evaluated from the point of view of exergy, economics, and environment. SketchUp, OpenStudio, and EnergyPlus are used to obtain the building loads, and the integrated system is dynamically modeled by the MATLAB software. The integrated system has been optimized based on different patterns, including monthly, seasonal, and two-state constant loads compared with hourly dynamic loads using an artificial intelligence genetic algorithm. The results show that the dynamic load pattern gives the highest exergy efficiency and the lowest total cost rate. The exergy efficiency and total cost rate in this scenario are 58.78% and 5.022 $/h, respectively. Also, the CO2 emission index has reached 363.1 g/kWh. Due to the subsidized price of grid electricity, there is a tendency to use low-capacity gas turbines and buy electricity from the grid for the dynamic model. The gas turbine capacity is 35.56 kW, and the system has purchased 242.4 MWh from the grid. Due to high heating loads, the capacity of the gas turbine significantly increases, and no electricity is purchased from the grid in the fixed-load pattern. The highest capacity of the gas turbine is 161.6 kW, which is obtained by a seasonal fixed-load pattern. Also, 994.9 MWh of electricity is sold to the grid in this mode.

AB Under the strain of global warming and the constant depletion of fossil energy supplies, the power system must pursue a mode of operation and development with minimal carbon emissions. There are methods to reduce carbon emissions on both the production and consumption sides, such as using renewable energy alternatives and aggregating distributed resources. However, the issue of how to reduce carbon emissions during the transmission of electricity is ignored. Consequently, the multi-objective optimal carbon emission flow (OCEF) is proposed, which takes into account not only the economic indices in the conventional optimal power flow (OPF) but also the reduction of unnecessary carbon emissions in the electricity transmission process, i.e., carbon emission flow losses (CEFL). This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based multi-objective OCEF solving method that handles the generator dispatching scheme by utilizing the current power system state parameters as known quantities. The case study on the IEEE-30 system demonstrates that the DRL-based OCEF solver is more effective, efficient, and stable than traditional methods.

AB Recently, artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods of building control or prediction have been confirmed to show high prediction accuracy and energy-efficient control performance of a single building environment. However, it can be difficult to optimize the indoor environments by previous approaches in a macroscopic system such as a building in which various physical factors interact according to operating HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning). According to these reasons, an innovative integrated prediction and control solution of the building environment is required. This study aimed at developing an integrated model based on artificial neural network (ANN) in a school building, which predicts predicted mean vote (PMV) and concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2), particulate matter 10 mu m (PM10), and particulate matter 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) after one cycle using current input variables. This model can be developed with training that prevents spurious regression while taking the advantage of supervised learning. In addition, it can overcome the limitations of existing machine learning models and, has utility in predicting the integrated environment of buildings. To achieve this goal, first, the structure of the integrated neural network was designed, and data acquisition was conducted according to the simulation of the target building. Second, the number of hidden layers was searched, which is suitable for predicting each target, by developing initial prediction models. Third, an optimal model was developed using multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). Particularly, the proposed method divides the internal structure of a neural network into independent and detailed prediction models, and it can prevent spurious regression by excluding irrelevant input variables in predicting each target variable. As the accuracy analysis of the optimal prediction model, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) between the predicted data and observed data are as follows: (1) 0.2243 for PMV, (2) 0.8816 for CO2, (3) 0.4645 for PM10, (4) and 0.6646 for PM2.5. Therefore, it was concluded that the proposed model has high accuracy and applicability for building integrated control. Also, this model will be applied to the optimal integrated control of indoor environments and HVAC energy.

AB Researchers' concentration has been on hybrid systems that can fulfill economic and environmental goals in recent years. In this study, first, the prediction of CO2 emission and electricity consumption of Saudi Arabia by 2040 is made by employing multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and support vector regression (SVR) methods to see the rate of CO2 emission and electricity consumption. In this regard, the most important parameters such as gross domestic product (GDP), population, oil consumption, natural gas consumption, and renewable consumption are considered. Estimating CO2 emission by MLP and electricity consumption by SVR showed 815 Mt/year and 475 TWh/year, respectively, where R2 for MLP and SVR was 0.99. Prediction results showed a 31% and 39% increase in CO2 emission and electricity consumption by 2040 compared to 2020. Second, the optimum combination of components for supplying demand load and desalination load in residential usages are found where 0% capacity shortage, 20-60$/t penalty for CO2 emission, sell back to the grid, and both fixed and random grid outages are considered. Load demands were considered under two winter and non-winter times so that 4,266, 2,346, and 3,300 kWh/day for Aseer, Tabuk, and the Eastern Region were shown, respectively. Results show that 0.12, 0.11, and 0.12 (kW (PV))/(kWh/day(load)) and 0.1, 0.08, and 0.08 (kW(Bat))/(kWh/day(load)) are required under the assumption of this study for Aseer, Tabuk, and the Eastern Region, respectively. Also, COEs for the proposed systems are 0.0934, 0.0915, and 0.0910 $/kWh for Aseer, Tabuk, and the Eastern Region, respectively. Also, it was found that renewable fractions (RFs) between 46% and 48% for all of the case studies could have rational COE and NPCs and fulfill the increasing rate of CO2 emission and electricity consumption. Finally, sensitivity analysis on grid CO2 emission and its penalty, load and solar Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), PV, and battery prices showed 45%-55%, 42%-52%, and 43%-49% RFs for Aseer, Tabuk, and the Eastern Region, respectively.
