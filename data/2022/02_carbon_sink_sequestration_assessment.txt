AB Minimizing waste entering US landfills has become increasingly difficult. Composting organic waste can assist in reducing the effects of landfill pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. To help automate this process, we apply computer vision techniques to train a classifier to distinguish between green and brown compost. The lack of labeled compost data and the challenges and dangers posed by collecting such data create a problem for the automation of composting. In this study, we propose CGBNet, a deep learning framework to differentiate between green and brown compost for the creation of healthy compost piles with an effective ratio of carbon to nitrogen. First, superclass and subclass classification are proposed as two methods of labeling and classifying data. Six deep learning models are then trained and evaluated on a newly formed dataset of 1,960 images using both label structures. Next, transfer learning is applied for feature extraction to boost performance using state-of-the-art deep learning models. The models showed improvements in performance generalization with less overfitting. The best-performing model, CGBNet, used transfer learning and subclass classification to obtain an accuracy of 95%, a 16% improvement in accuracy from the best performing superclass classification model trained without transfer learning. Superclass classification also showed significant improvements in performance and practicality with transfer learning, allowing for robust compost recognition systems to be more extensible while requiring less data and fewer parameters to train.

AB The Southern Ocean is a complex system yet is sparsely sampled in both space and time. These factors raise questions about the confidence in present sampling strategies and associated machine learning (ML) reconstructions. Previous studies have not yielded a clear understanding of the origin of uncertainties and biases for the reconstructions of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) at the surface ocean (pCO(2)(ocean)). We examine these questions through a series of semi-idealized observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) using a high-resolution (+/- 10 km) coupled physical and biogeochemical model (NEMO-PISCES, Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean, Pelagic Interactions Scheme for Carbon and Ecosystem Studies). Here we choose 1 year of the model sub-domain of 10 degrees of latitude (40-50 degrees S) by 20 degrees of longitude (10 degrees W-10 degrees E). This domain is crossed by the sub-Antarctic front and thus includes both the sub-Antarctic zone and the polar frontal zone in the south-east Atlantic Ocean, which are the two most sampled sub-regions of the Southern Ocean. We show that while this sub-domain is small relative to the Southern Ocean scales, it is representative of the scales of variability we aim to examine. The OSSEs simulated the observational scales of pCO(2)(ocean) in ways that are comparable to existing ocean CO2 observing platforms (ships, Wave Gliders, carbon floats, Saildrones) in terms of their temporal sampling scales and not necessarily their spatial ones. The pCO(2) reconstructions were carried out using a two-member ensemble approach that consisted of two machine learning (ML) methods, (1) the feed-forward neural network and (2) the gradient boosting machines. The baseline data were from the ship-based simulations mimicking ship-based observations from the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT). For each of the sampling-scale scenarios, we applied the two-member ensemble method to reconstruct the full sub-domain pCO(2)(ocean). The reconstruction skill was then assessed through a statistical comparison of reconstructed pCO(2) cean and the model domain mean. The analysis shows that uncertainties and biases for pCO(2)(ocean) reconstructions are very sensitive to both the spatial and the temporal scales of pCO(2) sampling in the model domain. The four key findings from our investigation are as follows: (1) improving ML-based pCO(2) reconstructions in the Southern Ocean requires simultaneous high-resolution observations (<3 d) of the seasonal cycle of the meridional gradients of pCO(2)(ocean); (2) Saildrones stand out as the optimal platforms to simultaneously address these requirements; (3) Wave Gliders with hourly/daily resolution in pseudomooring mode improve on carbon floats (10 d period), which suggests that sampling aliases from the 10 d sampling period might have a greater negative impact on their uncertainties, biases, and reconstruction means; and (4) the present seasonal sampling biases (towards summer) in SOCAT data in the Southern Ocean may be behind a significant winter bias in the reconstructed seasonal cycle of pCO(2)(ocean).

AB Urban forestry is regarded as the green infrastructure of cities, the analysis of which is of great significance for research on statistical analysis, such as greening, carbon sink, etc. on the basis of remote sensing detection. However, current urban forestry detection algorithms are focused on typical machine learning, whose results are limited by the manually selected features. Therefore, an innovative detection algorithm for analyzing urban forestry is proposed. First, the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm is adopted to segment the dataset, and the edge information of the object is preserved as much as possible. Second, a new network structure is constructed on the basis of Mask-RCNN to refine the detection results: (1) dilated convolution is adopted to replace the normal convolution of C1 in backbone (ResNet101) to increase the size of receptive field; (2) convolutional block attention module is introduced in C2 to give more weight to the shallow features such as edges and colors; and (3) atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) is added to branch of C3, enhancing the ability of multiscale fusion. With the effect of ASPP on detection results at different positions of backbone compared, the results show that the more backward the ASPP is, the more obvious the trend of negative correlation between network convergence speed and detection accuracy (C3: 89.2%, C4: 84.3%, and C5: 81.6%) is. The accuracy of random forest and support vector machines is also compared, with the former of 69.4% and the latter of 71.2%. In addition, the method of transfer learning to unmanned aerial vehicle data is used in this research, with the accuracy of 81.6%. The result shows that the improved segmentation model features better ability of learning shallow features than the original, able to accurately extract urban forestry from remote sensing images, which provides the reference for the further research on urban forestry detection, mapping, as well as the multisource remote sensing data fusion.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a key variable to determine soil functioning, ecosystem services, and global carbon cycles. Spectroscopy, particularly optical hyperspectral reflectance coupled with machine learning, can provide rapid, efficient, and cost-effective quantification of SOC. However, how to exploit soil hyperspectral reflectance to predict SOC concentration, and the potential performance of airborne and satellite data for predicting surface SOC at large scales remain relatively underknown. This study utilized a continental-scale soil laboratory spectral library (37,540 full-pedon 350-2500 nm reflectance spectra with SOC concentration of 0-780 g.kg(-1) across the US) to thoroughly evaluate seven machine learning algorithms including Partial-Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Ridge, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) along with four preprocessed spectra, i.e. original, vector normalization, continuum removal, and first-order derivative, to quantify SOC concentration. Furthermore, by using the coupled soil-vegetation-atmosphere radiative transfer model, we simulated twelve airborne and spaceborne hyper/multi-spectral remote sensing data from surface bare soil laboratory spectra to evaluate their potential for estimating SOC concentration of surface bare soils. Results show that LSTM achieved best predictive performance of quantifying SOC concentration for the whole data sets (R-2 = 0.96, RMSE = 30.81 g.kg(-1)), mineral soils (SOC <= 120 g.kg(-1), R-2 = 0.71, RMSE = 10.60 g.kg(-1)), and organic soils (SOC > 120 g.kg(-1), R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 62.31 g.kg(-1)). Spectral data preprocessing, particularly the first-order derivative, improved the performance of PLSR, RF, Ridge, KNN, and ANN, but not LSTM or CNN. We found that the SOC models of mineral and organic soils should be distinguished given their distinct spectral signatures. Finally, we identified that the shortwave infrared is vital for airborne and spaceborne hyperspectral sensors to monitor surface SOC. This study highlights the high accuracy of LSTM with hyperspectral/multispectral data to mitigate a certain level of noise (soil moisture <0.4 m(3).m(-3), green leaf area < 0.3 m(2).m(-2), plant residue <0.4 m(2).m(-2)) for quantifying surface SOC concentration. Forthcoming satellite hyperspectral missions like Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) have a high potential for future global soil carbon monitoring, while high-resolution satellite multispectral fusion data can be an alternative.

AB This study investigates the impacts of temperature, light-dark cycles (LD), and nitrogen-phosphorus ratios (NP) on Chlorella vulgaris microalgae biomass productivity (BP) and CO2 biofixation (R-CO2). Three artificial intelligence (AI) modeling approaches -boosted regression tree (BRT), artificial neural networks (ANN), and support vector regression (SVR) were applied. Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) was combined with each AI approach to predict BP and R-CO2. Real-life experimental data, according to Box-Behnken design (BBD) were employed to assess the models using relative error (RE), coefficient of determination (R-2), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute relative error (MARE), root mean square error (RMSE), and fractional bias (FB). The performance of the ANN and SVR models are comparable. However, the SVR model performs much better than the BRT and ANN models. Regarding R-CO2, the SVR model yields low errors (MAE of 0.0128, MARE of 0.4131, RMSE of 0.0189) with a high R-2 of 0.911. The value of FB is close to zero (0.0088), suggesting the model is reliable. The SVR model shows a better prediction capability of R-CO2 compared to BBD with a performance improvement of 17.16%. MARE of BBD for R-CO2 is 0.7409, which is higher than that of SVR model. Finally, the crow search algorithm was combined with the SVR for multi-objective optimization to determine the global optimal conditions for maximizing BP and R-CO2, respectively. The optimum conditions were calculated to be 40 C, 1:1 of N/P, and 12/12 h/h of LD with BP and R-CO2 of 0.0979 g L(-1)d(-1) and 0.1408 g L(-1)d(-1), respectively.

AB Carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration in underground formations is one of the effective processes of decreasing carbon emissions. CO2 injection in coalbeds improves methane recovery from coal formations (ECBM) with storing CO2 for environmental purposes. The performance ECBM process and CO2 injection depend on the wettability behavior in the coal formation. The wettability can be measured using different experiments; how-ever, these measurements are time-consuming, expensive, and highly inconsistent. Therefore, this paper aims to apply function networks (FN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forests (RF) to predict the contact angle in the coal formation. A dataset of 250 points was collected for different coal samples at different con-ditions. The different machine learning (ML) tools were used to predict contact angle (CA) as a function of coal properties, system pressure, and temperature. The training to testing data set ratio was used to be 70:30. A set of data hidden from the model was used for the validation purpose of the predictive models. The ML models showed a high capability to accurately predict the CA as a function of coal properties and the system conditions. The R-value (correlation coefficient) and the AAPE (average absolute percentage error) were used to evaluate the models' performance. R-values between actual and estimated CA from the FN model were calculated to be 0.97 and 0.97 comparing to 0.99, and 0.97 from the RF model in the case of training and testing datasets, while it was 0.95 and 0.96 for the SVM model. AAPE was less than 9% in the different ML models. This study delivers ML tools to accurately estimate the contact angle in the coal formation based on the coal properties, pressure and temperature, and water salinity without the need for experimental measurements of complicated calculations.

AB Identifying the complex relationships of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) of CO2, as an underlying factor of land surface, and atmosphere interactions is extremely important to the dynamic of carbon fluxes. Assessment of the model-based estimation of land-atmosphere carbon flux across various plant functional types (PFTs) can support the accurate identification of the carbon cycle and the adaptation and mitigation of climate change programs. Five different machine learning methods named Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) and Random Forest (RF) were used to predict daily NEE magnitude. In this study, 24 sites classified into four PFTs of Deciduous Broadleaf Forest (DBF), Evergreen Needle-leaf Forest (ENF), Mixed Forest (MF) and Grassland (GRA) were examined through ground -based flux tower data. The numbers of sites were six, four, six and eight for DBF, ENF, MF and GRA respectively, while measurement periods varied from two to thirteen years. The model calibration and validation were carried out using 70%and 30% of the data-set, respectively. The models' performances were assessed using statistical indices including the coefficient of determination (R-2), the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), bias error (Bias) and root mean square error (RMSE) through Python software. Based on statistical indices, the models showed different levels of capability when analyzing data from the DBF, ENF, MF and GRA sites. Among the models, RF showed the best performance, MLR showed the poorest performance, while SVM, GBM and DT models all had moderate responses. The effect of both air and soil temperatures, as the state variables, were examined to assess model performance. Whether soil temperature is included in the model plays a more important role in the performance of the models in grassland than in forest. Soil temperature inclusion, as an input variable, improved the models' performance about 14% in grassland, while it improved performance 2.4%, 2.4% and 3.5% in ENF, MF and DBF, respectively. Finally, to assess the models' performances, the NEE behavior in terms of over-or under-estimation was investigated across each PFT and over various phenological periods. The results indicate that high uncertainty occurs between the 140th and 220th days of the Julian calendar for forested areas and between the 120th and 210thdays for grassland.

AB Mangroves are well-recognized for their very high carbon sequestration potential. However, studies on their role in global carbon cycling and climate change are hindered due to lack of operational methodologies to model and map their biophysical properties. This study establishes a robust methodological protocol for aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation using i) field measurements, ii) a generic (in the absence of species-specific) allometric equation, iii) multi-sensor/polarization SAR data and derived variables thereof, and iv) machine learning models; that demonstrated high prediction accuracy (R-2 = 0.93) and low uncertainty (mean <= 3% and median <= 1.5%) for a mangrove forest. Following stratified random sampling and on-field accessibility criteria, we laid out 314 elementary sampling points of 0.04 ha each at Bhitarkanika wildlife sanctuary (BWS), India and measured circumference at breast height (CBH) and canopy tree height for 18 species. The estimated AGB range of a generic allometric equation was 9-474 Mg/ha for BWS, with a major representation of 9-347 Mg/ha. We utilized Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and derived their variables for AGB prediction. Compared to single sensor-based model, we observed higher prediction accuracy for combined sensor data (R-2 = 0.63, 0.87, 0.93; RMSE = 66.75, 39.95, 28.35 Mg/ha; MAE = 52.63, 24.21, 19.55 Mg/ha; and Bias = 3.42, 0.22, 2.15 Mg/ha for C, L and C & L bands respectively using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) over Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The higher uncertainty pixels represented seasonal grassland and scrubs in the swampy areas and along the fringes of the creeks that experience diurnal tidal fluctuations. This robust methodology can be replicated for AGB estimates in other mangrove ecosystems to meet the operational carbon accounting requirements of various entities.

AB Estimating gross primary production (GPP), the gross uptake of CO2 by vegetation, is a fundamental prerequisite for understanding and quantifying the terrestrial carbon cycle. Over the last decade, multiple approaches have been developed to derive spatiotemporal dynamics of GPP combining in situ observations and remote sensing data using machine learning techniques or semiempirical models. However, no high spatial resolution GPP product exists so far that is derived entirely from satellite-based remote sensing data. Sentinel-2 satellites are expected to open new opportunities to analyze ecosystem processes with spectral bands chosen to study vegetation between 10- and 20-m spatial resolutions with five-day revisit frequency. Of particular relevance is the availability of red-edge bands that are suitable for deriving estimates of canopy chlorophyll content that are expected to be much better than any previous global mission. Here, we analyzed whether red-edge-based and near-infrared-based vegetation indices (VIs) or machine learning techniques that consider VIs, all spectral bands, and their nonlinear interactions could predict daily GPP derived from 58 eddy covariance sites. Using linear regressions based on classic VIs, including near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), we achieved prediction powers of R-10-fold(2) = 0.51 and an RMSE10-fold = 2.95 [mu mol CO2 m(-2)s(-1)] in a 10-fold cross validation. Chlorophyll index red (CIR) and the novel kernel NDVI (kNVDI) achieved significantly higher prediction powers of around R-10-fold(2) approximate to 0.61 and RMSE10-fold approximate to 2.57 [mu mol CO2 m(-2)s(-1)]. Using all spectral bands and VIs jointly in a machine learning prediction framework allowed us to predict GPP with R-10-fold(2) = 0.71 and RMSE10-fold = 2.68 [mu mol CO2 m(-2)s(-1)]. Despite the high-power prediction when machine learning techniques are used, under water-stress scenarios or heat waves, optical information alone is not enough to predict GPP properly. In general, our analyses show the potential of nonlinear combinations of spectral bands and VIs for monitoring GPP across ecosystems at a level of accuracy comparable to previous works, which, however, required additional meteorological drivers.

AB Biomass is a renewable and sustainable energy resource that can potentially be substituted for fossil fuels, which have a negative impact on the environment including the production of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Forest carbon stocks are also of growing interest with regard to both GHG sequestration and renewable energy supply; fast-growing trees are of particular interest in this area. Producing a highly accurate estimation of the aboveground biomass (AGB) of any forest plantation is challenging. In this study, we apply machine learning (ML) techniques to model the AGB of fast-growing trees, namely E. camaldulensis, A. hybrid, and L. leucocephala. It is found that the random forest algorithm has the highest prediction accuracy (R-2 of over 0.95, and normalized root mean square error of about 0.20), when compared to other ML algorithms and traditional allometric equations for estimating AGB. This work offers an alternative of estimating AGB for the tropical fast growing trees through the synergy of simple tree characteristics and modeling algorithms.

AB CO2 injection into the underlying water leg of depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs is a desirable option for carbon storage as demonstrated by existing industrial-scale storage projects in these geologic environments. This study sheds light on the effect of residual methane on the CO2 storage efficiency as a screening criterion for selecting a water-bearing zone of a depleted gas reservoir to store CO2. Using compositional reservoir simulations, we have evaluated the impact of residual methane on the injectivity, operational pressure, and long-term CO2 trapping efficiency during injection and postinjection stage in a reservoir model representative of the so-called "HC sand" gas reservoir in the High Island 24L field located in the offshore Texas State Waters. Results suggest that the presence of residual hydrocarbon gas negatively affects CO2 residual and dissolution trapping because it enhances the injectivity and pressure management arising from the increased mobility of CO2 plume in the vicinity of the injection zone due to its mixing with the resident residual hydrocarbon gas. We further investigate the application of artificial neural network (ANN)-based proxy models for fast-track modeling of CO2 storage in geologic structures associated with depleted gas reservoirs, aiming at the prediction of CO2 trapping efficiency. We then use the developed ANN model to perform Monte Carlo simulations for quantifying the uncertainty of geologic and reservoir parameters on CO2 trapping efficiency in these formations. It becomes evident that the residual hydrocarbon saturation is a key screening criterion for the storage site selection. The developed data-driven model can offer a robust and fast tool for screening the water-bearing zone of the depleted gas reservoirs by evaluating the efficiency of CO2 storage.

AB There is global interest in spectroscopy and the development of large and diverse soil spectral libraries (SSL) to model soil organic carbon (SOC) and monitor, report, and verify (MRV) its changes. The reason is that increasing SOC can improve food production and mitigate climate change. However, 'global' modelling of SOC with such diverse and hyperdimensional SSLs do not generalise well locally, e.g. at a field scale. To address this challenge, we propose deep transfer learning (DTL) to leverage useful information from large-scale SSLs to assist local modelling. We used one global, three country-specific SSLs and data from three local sites with DTL to improve the modelling and localise the SOC estimates in individual fields or farms in each country. With DTL, we transferred instances from the SSLs, representations from one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1DCNNs) trained on the SSLs, and both instances and representations to improve local modelling. Transferring instances effectively used information from the global SSL to most accurately estimate SOC in each site, reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) by 25.8% on average compared with local modelling. Our results highlight the effectiveness of DTL and the value of diverse, global SSLs for accurate local SOC predictions. Applying DTL with a global SSL one could estimate SOC anywhere in the world more accurately, rapidly, and cost-effectively, enabling MRV protocols to monitor SOC changes.

AB Higher-resolution wall-to-wall carbon monitoring in tropical Africa across a range of woodland types is necessary in reducing uncertainty in the global carbon budget and improving accounting for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation Plus (REDD+). This study uses Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery combined with climatic and edaphic variables to estimate the regional distribution of aboveground biomass (AGB) for the year 2020 over the Cross River State, a tropical forest region in Nigeria, using random forest (RF) machine learning. Forest inventory plots were collected over the whole state for training and testing of the RF algorithm, and spread over undisturbed and disturbed tropical forests, and woodlands in croplands and plantations. The maximum AGB plot was estimated to be 588 t/ha with an average of 121.98 t/ha across the entire Cross River State. AGB estimated using random forest yielded an R-2 of 0.88, RMSE of 40.9 t/ha, a relRMSE of 30%, bias of +7.5 t/ha and a total woody regional AGB of 0.246 Pg for the Cross River State. These results compare favorably to previous tropical AGB products; with total AGB of 0.290, 0.253, 0.330 and 0.124 Pg, relRMSE of 49.69, 57.09, 24.06 and 56.24% and -41, -48, -17 and -50 t/ha bias over the Cross River State for the Saatchi, Baccini, Avitabile and ESA CCI maps, respectively. These are all compared to the current REDD+ estimate of total AGB over the Cross River State of 0.268 Pg. This study shows that obtaining independent reference plot datasets, from a variety of woodland cover types, can reduce uncertainties in local to regional AGB estimation compared with those products which have limited tropical African and Nigerian woodland reference plots. Though REDD+ biomass in the region is relatively larger than the estimates of this study, REDD+ provided only regional biomass rather than pixel-based biomass and used estimated tree height rather than the actual tree height measurement in the field. These may cast doubt on the accuracy of the estimated biomass by REDD+. These give the biomass map of this current study a comparative advantage over others. The 20 m wall-to-wall biomass map of this study could be used as a baseline for REDD+ monitoring, evaluation, and reporting for equitable distribution of payment for carbon protection benefits and its management.

AB Inaccurate parameter estimation is a significant source of uncertainty in complex terrestrial biosphere models. Model parameters may have large spatial variability, even within a vegetation type. Model uncertainty from parameters can be significantly reduced by model-data fusion (MDF), which, however, is difficult to implement over a large region with traditional methods due to the high computational cost. This study proposed a hybrid modeling approach that couples a terrestrial biosphere model with a data-driven machine learning method, which is able to consider both satellite information and the physical mechanisms. We developed a two-step framework to estimate the essential parameters of the revised Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS) pixel by pixel using the satellite-derived leaf area index (LAI) and gross primary productivity (GPP) products as "true values." The first step was to estimate the optimal parameters for each sample using a modified adaptive surrogate modeling algorithm (MASM). We applied the Gaussian process regression algorithm (GPR) as a surrogate model to learn the relationship between model parameters and errors. In our second step, we built an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model between the optimized parameters and local environmental variables. The trained XGBoost model was then used to predict optimal parameters spatially across the deciduous forests in the eastern United States. The results showed that the parameters were highly variable spatially and quite different from the default values over forests, and the simulation errors of the GPP and LAI could be markedly reduced with the optimized parameters. The effectiveness of the optimized model in estimating GPP, ecosystem respiration (ER), and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were also tested through site validation. The optimized model reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) from 7.03 to 6.22 gC m(-2) d(-1) for GPP, 2.65 to 2.11 gC m(-2) d(-1) for ER, and 4.45 to 4.38 gC m(-2) d(-1) for NEE. The mean annual GPP, ER, and NEE of the region from 2000 to 2019 were 5.79, 4.60, and -1.19 Pg yr(-1), respectively. The strategy used in this study requires only a few hundred model runs to calibrate regional parameters and is readily applicable to other complex terrestrial biosphere models with different spatial resolutions. Our study also emphasizes the necessity of pixel-level parameter calibration and the value of remote sensing products for per-pixel parameter optimization.

AB In the present study, a two-step machine learning approach is proposed and tested based on the Greenhouse gases Observing SATllite (GOSAT) spectral measurements to efficiently retrieve the atmospheric CO 2 column density. A simple one-dimensional line-by-line forward radiation model is developed to simulate the GOSAT observed spectra, which is used to generate the training data for the two-step machine learning model. By using the two-step machine learning model, the atmospheric spectral optical thickness can be retrieved first, and then the CO 2 column density is retrieved from the optical thickness spectrum later. As a proof-of-concept study, the model has been applied to retrieve CO 2 column density in Australia for clear sky conditions from the GOSAT observed 1.6 mu m spectra. Results have shown that the accuracy of the proposed method for CO 2 column density retrieval is about 3 ppm but the efficiency is found to be excellent. Further improvements for improving the retrieval accuracy are discussed. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent publications indicate that the Amazon may be acting more as a carbon source than a sink in some regions. Moreover, the Amazon is a source of moisture for other regions in the continent, and deforestation over the years may be reducing this function. In this work, we analyze the impacts of elevated CO2 (eCO(2)) and land use change (LUC) on gross primary productivity (GPP) and evaporation in the southern Amazon (7 degrees S 14 degrees S, 66 degrees W 51 degrees W), which suffered strong anthropogenic influence in the period of 1981-2010. We ran four dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs), isolating historical CO2, constant CO2, LUC, and potential natural vegetation scenarios with three climate variable data sets: precipitation, temperature, and shortwave radiation. We compared the outputs to five "observational" data sets obtained through eddy covariance, remote sensing, meteorological measurements, and machine learning. The results indicate that eCO(2) may have offset deforestation, with GPP increasing by similar to 13.5% and 9.3% (dry and rainy seasons, respectively). After isolating the LUC effect, a reduction in evaporation of similar to 4% and similar to 1.2% (dry and rainy seasons, respectively) was observed. The analysis of forcings in subregions under strong anthropogenic impact revealed a reduction in precipitation of similar to 15 and 30 mm, and a temperature rise of 1 degrees C and 0.6 degrees C (dry and rainy seasons, respectively). Differences in the implementation of plant physiology and leaf area index in the DGVMs introduced some uncertainties in the interpretation of the results. Nevertheless, we consider that it was an important exercise given the relevance.

AB The ocean reduces human impacts on global climate by absorbing and sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere. To quantify global, time-resolved air-sea CO2 fluxes, surface ocean pCO(2) is needed. A common approach for estimating full-coverage pCO(2) is to train a machine learning algorithm on sparse in situ pCO(2) data and associated physical and biogeochemical observations. Though these associated variables have understood relationships to pCO(2), it is often unclear how they drive pCO(2) outputs. Here, we make two advances that enhance connections between physical understanding and reconstructed pCO(2). First, we apply pre-processing to the pCO(2) data to remove the direct effect of temperature. This enhances the biogeochemical/physical component of pCO(2) in the target variable and reduces the complexity that the machine learning must disentangle. Second, we demonstrate that the resulting algorithm has physically understandable connections between input data and the output biogeochemical/physical component of pCO(2). The final pCO(2) reconstruction agrees modestly better with independent data than most other approaches. Uncertainties in the reconstructed pCO(2) and impacts on the estimated CO2 fluxes are quantified. Uncertainty in piston velocity drives substantial flux uncertainties in some regions, but does not increase globally integrated estimates of uncertainty in CO2 fluxes from observation-based products. Our reconstructed CO2 fluxes show larger interannual variability than smoother neural network approaches, but a lesser trend since 2005. We estimate an air-sea flux of -1.8 PgC/yr (anthropogenic flux of -2.3 +/- 0.5 PgC/yr) for 1990-2019, agreeing with other data products and the Global Carbon Budget 2020 (-2.3 +/- 0.4 PgC/yr).

AB Coupled physical-biogeochemical models can fill the spatial and temporal gap in ocean carbon observations. Challenges of applying a coupled physical-biogeochemical model in the regional ocean include the reasonable prescription of carbon model boundary conditions, lack of in situ observations, and the oversimplification of certain biogeochemical processes. In this study, we applied a coupled physical-biogeochemical model (Regional Ocean Modelling System, ROMS) to the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and achieved an unprecedented 20-year high-resolution (5 km, 1/22 degrees) hindcast covering the period of 2000 to 2019. The biogeochemical model incorporated the dynamics of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pools and the formation and dissolution of carbonate minerals. The biogeochemical boundaries were interpolated from NCAR's CESM2-WACCM-FV2 solution after evaluating the performance of 17 GCMs in the GoM waters. Model outputs included carbon system variables of wide interest, such as pCO(2), pH, aragonite saturation state (Omega(Arag)), calcite saturation state (Omega(Calc)), CO2 air-sea flux, and carbon burial rate. The model's robustness is evaluated via extensive model-data comparison against buoys, remote-sensingbased machine learning (ML) products, and ship-based measurements. A reassessment of air-sea CO2 flux with previous modeling and observational studies gives us confidence that our model provides a robust and updated CO2 flux estimation, and NGoM is a stronger carbon sink than previously reported. Model results reveal that the GoM water has been experiencing a similar to 0.0016 yr(-1) decrease in surface pH over the past 2 decades, accompanied by a similar to 1.66 mu atm yr(-1) increase in sea surface pCO(2). The air-sea CO2 exchange estimation confirms in accordance with several previous models and ocean surface pCO(2) observations that the river-dominated northern GoM (NGoM) is a substantial carbon sink, and the open GoM is a carbon source during summer and a carbon sink for the rest of the year. Sensitivity experiments are conducted to evaluate the impacts of river inputs and the global ocean via model boundaries. The NGoM carbon system is directly modified by the enormous carbon inputs (similar to 15.5 Tg C yr(-1) DIC and similar to 2.3 Tg C yr(-1) DOC) from the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River System (MARS). Additionally, nutrient-stimulated biological activities create a similar to 105 times higher particulate organic matter burial rate in NGoM sediment than in the case without river-delivered nutrients. The carbon system condition of the open ocean is driven by inputs from the Caribbean Sea via the Yucatan Channel and is affected more by thermal effects than biological factors.

AB The fine-scale mapping of soil organic matter (SOM) in croplands is vital for the sustainable management of soil. Traditionally, SOM mapping relies on laboratory methods that are labor-intensive and costly. Recent advances in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) afford new opportunities for rapid and low-cost SOM mapping at the field scale. However, the conversion from UAV measurements to SOM maps requires specific transfer models that still rely on local sampling. This study aimed to develop a method for predicting topsoil SOM at a high resolution on the field scale based on soil color information gained from low-altitude UAV imagery and machine learning. For this, we performed a UAV survey in cropland within the German loess belt. We used two fields, one for training and one for validation of the model, to test the model transferability. We analyzed 91 soil samples for SOM in the laboratory for the model calibration and 8 additional samples for external model validation. A random forest model (RF) showed good performance for the prediction of SOM based on UAV-derived color information with an RMSE of 0.13% and with an RPIQ of 2.42. The RF model was used to predict SOM at a point-support of 1 x 1 m. The SOM map revealed spatial patterns within the fields with a uniform spread of the prediction uncertainty. The validation of the model performed similarly to the calibration with an RMSE of 0.12% and an RPIQ of 2.05, albeit with a slight bias of 0.05%. This validation using external data showed that prediction models are transferable to neighboring fields, thus permitting the prediction on larger scale farms or enabling carbon monitoring over time.

AB Various machine learning methods were attempted in the global mapping of surface ocean partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)) to reduce the uncertainty of the global ocean CO2 sink estimate due to undersampling of pCO(2). In previous research, the predictors of pCO(2) were usually selected empirically based on theoretic drivers of surface ocean pCO(2), and the same combination of predictors was applied in all areas except where there was a lack of coverage. However, the differences between the drivers of surface ocean pCO(2) in different regions were not considered. In this work, we combined the stepwise regression algorithm and a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) to select predictors of pCO(2) based on the mean absolute error in each of the 11 biogeochemical provinces defined by the self-organizing map (SOM) method. Based on the predictors selected, a monthly global 1 circle x 1 circle surface ocean pCO(2) product from January 1992 to August 2019 was constructed. Validation of different combinations of predictors based on the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) dataset version 2020 and independent observations from time series stations was carried out. The prediction of pCO(2) based on region-specific predictors selected by the stepwise FFNN algorithm was more precise than that based on predictors from previous research. Applying the FFNN size-improving algorithm in each province decreased the mean absolute error (MAE) of the global estimate to 11.32 mu atm and the root mean square error (RMSE) to 17.99 mu atm. The script file of the stepwise FFNN algorithm and pCO(2) product are distributed through the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Marine Science Data Center (IOCAS, , Zhong, 2021.

AB Net primary productivity (NPP) is an important index to evaluate the carbon absorption capacity in agricultural ecosystems, timely and accurate spatial-temporal variations of NPP play a significant role in guiding agricultural production. Currently, NPP observation at the canopy scale is primarily based on the chamber method. However, upscaling the spatial-temporal estimates of NPP at the canopy scale is still challenging. In this study, maize daytime NPP was measured by the chamber, and multispectral images of maize canopies were obtained via unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral system. We explored the potential of multispectral images for estimating maize daytime NPP at the canopy scale. Four machine learning algorithms were employed to estimate daytime NPP using ground factors and vegetation indices (VIs) x photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) independently. NPP estimation models based on the gradient boosting regression (GBR), random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR) using ground factors outperformed the VIs x PAR-based model, barring the ridge regression (RR) model. Among them, the GBR-based models performed better, and the model using ground factors (R2 = 0.958) outperformed those using VIs x PAR (R2 = 0.899). However, the ground factor-based GBR model was complex and contained more input parameters, thus making it highly-time and labor-intensive, and highly destructive. Moreover, ground factor-based GBR model could not reflect the variation of NPP in maize canopy. The VIs x PAR-based GBR model could explain 89.9% of the daytime NPP, and it only required two parameters, including VIs and PAR. Therefore, the VIs x PAR-based GBR model can easily obtain high resolution and long time-series NPP information nondestructively for a large range. This study reveals that maize daytime NPP can be estimated using high-resolution UAV multispectral images and provides a good reference for promoting the monitoring and upscaling of NPP observations.

AB As the largest source of uncertainty in carbon cycle studies, accurate quantification of gross primary productivity (GPP) is critical for the global carbon budget in the context of global climate change. Numerous vegetation indices (VIs) based on satellite data have participated in the construction of GPP models. However, the relative performance of various VIs in predicting GPP and what additional factors should be combined with them to reveal the photosynthetic capacity of vegetation mechanistically better are still poorly understood. We constructed two types of models (universal and plant functional type [PFT]-specific) for solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and Leaf Area Index (LAI) based on two widely used machine learning algorithms, i.e., the random forest (RF) and back propagation neural network (BPNN) algorithms. A total of thirty plant traits and environmental factors with legacy effects are considered in the model. We then systematically investigated the ancillary variables that best match each vegetation index in estimating global GPP. Four types of models (universal and PFT-specific, RF and BPNN) consistently show that SIF performs best when modeled using a single vegetation index (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 2.24 g C center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1)); however, NIRv combined with CO2, plant traits, and climatic factors can achieve the highest prediction accuracy (R-2 = 0.87, RMSE = 1.40 g C center dot m(-2)center dot d(-1)). Plant traits effectively enhance all prediction models' accuracy, and climatic variables are essential factors in improving the accuracy of NIRv- or LAI-based GPP models, but not the accuracy of SIF-based models. Our findings provide valuable information for the configuration of the data-driven models to improve the accuracy of predicting GPP and provide insights into the physiological and ecological mechanisms underpinning GPP prediction.

TI Variability in the Global Ocean Carbon Sink From 1959 to 2020 by Correcting Models With Observations

AB The ocean reduces human impact on the climate by absorbing and sequestering CO2. From 1950s to the 1980s, observations of pCO(2) and related ocean carbon variables were sparse and uncertain. Thus, global ocean biogeochemical models (GOBMs) have been the basis for quantifying the ocean carbon sink. The LDEO-Hybrid Physics Data product (LDEO-HPD) interpolates sparse surface ocean pCO(2) data to global coverage by using GOBMs as priors, and applying machine learning to estimate full-coverage corrections. The largest component of the GOBM corrections are climatological. This is consistent with recent findings of large seasonal discrepancies in GOBMs, but contrasts the long-held view that interannual variability is a major source of GOBM error. This supports extension of the LDEO-HPD pCO(2) product back to 1959, using a climatology of model-observation misfits prior to 1982. Consistent with previous studies for 1980 onward, air-sea CO2 fluxes for 1959-2020 demonstrate response to atmospheric pCO(2) growth and volcanic eruptions.

AB The ocean plays a critical role in modulating climate change by sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere. Quantifying the CO2 flux across the air-sea interface requires time-dependent maps of surface ocean partial pressure of CO2 (pCO(2)), which can be estimated using global ocean biogeochemical models (GOBMs) and observational-based data products. GOBMs are internally consistent, mechanistic representations of the ocean circulation and carbon cycle, and have long been the standard for making spatio-temporally resolved estimates of air-sea CO2 fluxes. However, there are concerns about the fidelity of GOBM flux estimates. Observation-based products have the strength of being data-based, but the underlying data are sparse and require significant extrapolation to create global full-coverage flux estimates. The Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory-Hybrid Physics Data (LDEO-HPD) pCO(2) product is a new approach to estimating the temporal evolution of surface ocean pCO(2) and air-sea CO2 exchange. LDEO-HPD uses machine learning to merge high-quality observations with state-of-the-art GOBMs. We train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm to learn a non-linear relationship between model-data mismatch and observed predictors. GOBM fields are then corrected with the predicted model-data misfit to estimate real-world pCO(2) for 1982-2018. The resulting reconstruction by LDEO-HPD is in better agreement with independent pCO(2) observations than other currently available observation-based products. Within uncertainties, LDEO-HPD global ocean uptake of CO2 agrees with other products and the Global Carbon Budget 2020.

AB Uncertainties in the CO2 flux in the Southern Ocean, produced by a lack of direct wintertime observations, can be addressed by a combination of pseudo observations and neural network machine learning-based mapping. The Southern Ocean is an important sink of anthropogenic CO2, but it is among the least well-observed ocean basins, and consequentially substantial uncertainties in the CO2 flux reconstruction exist. A recent attempt to address historically sparse wintertime sampling produced 'pseudo' wintertime observations of surface pCO(2) using subsurface summertime observations south of the Antarctic Polar Front. Here, we present an estimate of the Southern Ocean CO2 sink that combines a machine learning-based mapping method with an updated set of pseudo observations that increases regional wintertime data coverage by 68% compared with the historical dataset. Our results confirm the suggestion that improved winter coverage has a modest impact on the reconstruction, slightly strengthening the uptake trend in the 2000s. After also adjusting for surface boundary layer temperature effects, we find a 2004-2018 mean sink of -0.16 +/- 0.07 PgC yr(-1) south of the Polar Front and -1.27 +/- 0.23 PgC yr(-1) south of 35 degrees S, consistent with independent estimates from atmospheric data.

AB Prediction of wetland greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes has been a challenging undertaking. Machine learning techniques such as the artificial neural network (ANN) has a strong potential to provide high quality predictions of the wetland GHG fluxes. We developed eight different ANN models and investigated their suitability to predict the major GHG fluxes (CO2 and CH4) in coastal salt marshes (dominated by Spartina alterniflora) of Waquoit Bay, Massachusetts, USA. Based on the dominant environmental drivers, the daytime net uptake fluxes of CO2 were predicted as a function of photosynthetically active radiation, soil temperature (ST), and porewater salinity (SS). The net emission fluxes of CH4 were predicted as a function of ST and SS. Our models with the radial basis function neural network (RBNN) provided the most accurate and least-biased predictions of the net CO2 uptake (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency, NSE = 0.98) and CH4 emission (NSE = 0.90-0.92). The linear layer neural network generated the least successful and most biased predictions of the GHG fluxes (NSE = 0.48-0.80). Other ANNs, including the commonly-used feed forward neural network (FFNN), provided less accurate and more biased predictions of the CO2 (NSE = 0.86-0.97) and CH4 (NSE = 0.73-0.89) fluxes than the RBNN. We, therefore, recommend using RBNN as the first choice and FFNN (or its variant) as the second choice for predicting the GHG fluxes in coastal salt marshes. Our findings and tools would help derive plausible scenarios and guidelines for restoration, monitoring, and maintenance of coastal salt marshes in the U.S. and beyond.

AB Soil photoautotrophic prokaryotes and micro-eukaryotes - known as soil algae - are, together with heterotrophic microorganisms, a constitutive part of the microbiome in surface soils. Similar to plants, they fix atmospheric carbon (C) through photosynthesis for their own growth, yet their contribution to global and regional biogeochemical C cycling still remains quantitatively elusive. Here, we compiled an extensive dataset on soil algae to generate a better understanding of their distribution across biomes and predict their productivity at a global scale by means of machine learning modelling. We found that, on average, (5.5 +/- 3.4) x 10(6) algae inhabit each gram of surface soil. Soil algal abundance especially peaked in acidic, moist and vegetated soils. We estimate that, globally, soil algae take up around 3.6 Pg C per year, which corresponds to c. 6% of the net primary production of terrestrial vegetation. We demonstrate that the C fixed by soil algae is crucial to the global C cycle and should be integrated into land-based efforts to mitigate C emissions.

AB Changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are a major source of uncertainty for the evolution of atmospheric CO2 concentration during the 21st century. They are usually simulated by models dividing SOC into conceptual pools with contrasted turnover times. The lack of reliable methods to initialize these models, by correctly distributing soil carbon amongst their kinetic pools, strongly limits the accuracy of their simulations. Here, we demonstrate that PARTYsoc, a machine-learning model based on Rock-Eval (R) thermal analysis, optimally partitions the active- and stable-SOC pools of AMG, a simple and well-validated SOC dynamics model, accounting for effects of soil management history. Furthermore, we found that initializing the SOC pool sizes of AMG using machine learning strongly improves its accuracy when reproducing the observed SOC dynamics in nine independent French long-term agricultural experiments. Our results indicate that multi-compartmental models of SOC dynamics combined with a robust initialization can simulate observed SOC stock changes with excellent precision. We recommend exploring their potential before a new generation of models of greater complexity becomes operational. The approach proposed here can be easily implemented on soil monitoring networks, paving the way towards precise predictions of SOC stock changes over the next decades.

AB Due to the spatial and temporal differences in greenhouse gas emissions at the water-air interface of reservoirs, it is difficult to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions from the reservoir accurately. In order to explore a new method for estimating greenhouse gas fluxes from reservoirs, a vertical transport model of greenhouse gases in waters is constructed based on the convection-diffusion model, and a set of physical experiments are carried out to test the rationality of the new model. The results show that vertical distributions of gas concentrations measured in experiments are identified to simulation results of the convection-diffusion model, so it is necessary to consider the convection term in gas transport in waters. In addition, the gas fluxes calculated by the convection-diffusion model are compared with those measured by the static floating chamber method, and the maximum relative error is 21.43%.

AB Uptake of atmospheric carbon by the ocean, especially at high latitudes, plays an important role in offsetting anthropogenic emissions. At the surface of the Southern Ocean south of 30(circle)S, the ocean carbon uptake, which had been weakening in 1990s, strengthened in the 2000s. However, sparseness of in-situ measurements in the ocean interior make it difficult to compute changes in carbon storage below the surface. Here we develop a machine-learning model, which can estimate concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the Southern Ocean up to 4 km depth only using data available at the ocean surface. Our model is fast and computationally inexpensive. We apply it to calculate trends in DIC concentrations over the past three decades and find that DIC decreased in the 1990s and 2000s, but has increased, in particular in the upper ocean since the 2010s. However, the particular circulation dynamics that drove these changes may have differed across zonal sectors of the Southern Ocean. While the near-surface decrease in DIC concentrations would enhance atmospheric CO2 uptake continuing the previously-found trends, weakened connectivity between surface and deep layers and build-up of DIC in deep waters could reduce the ocean's carbon storage potential. Dissolved carbon concentrations in the ocean interior are computed by a deep-learning model using ocean surface data. In the Southern Ocean, they decreased in the 1990s-2000s and increased since 2010, reducing anthropogenic carbon uptake potential.

AB Due to the great structural and species diversity of tropical forests and limitations of the methods used to estimate aboveground biomass, there is uncertainty in quantifying its carbon sequestration potential. Measuring carbon sequestered in the terrestrial ecosystem and monitoring its dynamics is one of the key objectives in sustainable development goals. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has evolved as a key satellite technology in measuring and monitoring terrestrial carbon sink stored as biomass in plants. This study attempts to model forest above-ground biomass (AGB) using a random forest machine-learning approach where the predictor variables are from C-band (Radarsat-2), L-band (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2), and multi-temporal spaceborne LiDAR data from the GEDI platform. Training and validation data for the machine learning approach are obtained from the field measured inventory campaigns to evaluate the modeled forest biomass accuracies. The results show that variables from L-band (HH, HV), C-band (HV), and canopy height from the GEDI LiDAR platform performed effectively to model forest AGB with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.81 and root mean squared error (rmse) of 19.35 Mg/ha (%rmse - 17.17). In the case of single frequency SAR data, the analysis shows that the model derived from the L-band SAR data and LiDAR performed comparably better than the combination of C-band SAR and LiDAR data with an R-2 of 0.78 and rmse of 21.36 Mg/ha (%rmse - 18.94). The results, thus, demonstrate the potential of SAR data (both single frequency and multiple frequencies) in combination with GEDI LiDAR data in effectively modeling AGB over highly biodiverse tropical forest regions.

AB Forests are the largest terrestrial ecosystem carbon pool and provide the most important nature-based climate mitigation pathway. Compared with belowground biomass (BGB) and soil carbon, aboveground biomass (AGB) is more sensitive to human disturbance and climate change. Therefore, accurate forest AGB mapping will help us better assess the mitigation potential of forests against climate change. Here, we developed six models to estimate national forest AGB using six machine learning algorithms based on 52,415 spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) footprints and 22 environmental features for China in 2007. The results showed that the ensemble model generated by the stacking algorithm performed best with a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.76 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 22.40 Mg/ha. The verifications at pixel level (R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 16.08 Mg/ha) and provincial level (R-2 = 0.53, RMSE = 14.05 Mg/ha) indicated the accuracy of the estimated forest AGB map is satisfactory. The forest AGB density of China was estimated to be 53.16 +/- 1.63 Mg/ha, with a total of 11.00 +/- 0.34 Pg. Net primary productivity (NPP), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), average annual rainfall, and annual temperature anomaly are the five most important environmental factors for forest AGB estimation. The forest AGB map we produced is expected to reduce the uncertainty of forest carbon source and sink estimations.

AB Carbon geo-sequestration (CGS), as a well-known procedure, is employed to reduce/store greenhouse gases. Wettability behavior is one of the important parameters in the geological CO2 sequestration process. Few models have been reported for characterizing the contact angle of the brine/CO2/mineral system at different environmental conditions. In this study, a smart machine learning model, namely Gene Expression Programming (GEP), was implemented to model the wettability behavior in a ternary system of CO2, brine, and mineral under different operating conditions, including salinity, pressure, and temperature. The presented models provided an accurate estimation for the receding, static, and advancing contact angles of brine/CO2 on various minerals, such as calcite, feldspar, mica, and quartz. A total of 630 experimental data points were utilized for establishing the correlations. Both statistical evaluation and graphical analyses were performed to show the reliability and performance of the developed models. The results showed that the implemented GEP model accurately predicted the wettability behavior under various operating conditions and a few data points were detected as probably doubtful. The average absolute percent relative error (AAPRE) of the models proposed for calcite, feldspar, mica, and quartz were obtained as 5.66%, 1.56%, 14.44%, and 13.93%, respectively, which confirm the accurate performance of the GEP algorithm. Finally, the investigation of sensitivity analysis indicated that salinity and pressure had the utmost influence on contact angles of brine/CO2 on a range of different minerals. In addition, the effect of the accurate estimation of wettability on CO2 column height for CO2 sequestration was illustrated. According to the impact of wettability on the residual and structural trapping mechanisms during the geo-sequestration of the carbon process, the outcomes of the GEP model can be beneficial for the precise prediction of the capacity of these mechanisms.

TI Estimating Carbon Stocks and Sequestration With Their Valuation Under a Changing Land Use Scenario: A Multi-Temporal Research in Abha City, Saudi Arabia

AB Urbanization and land-use change are significant contributors to cumulative greenhouse gas emissions, causing climate change and environmental damage. Research on land-use-derived carbon storage and sequestration capability is crucial for emission reduction strategy and sustainable development. Because cities are becoming significant sources of carbon emissions, an accurate assessment of city-level carbon storage and sequestration is now required. This study intended to estimate the carbon storage and sequestration capabilities using the InVEST model under different land use land cover (LULC) classes in Abha, Saudi Arabia. We used a support vector machine (SVM) for LULC mapping. For the future forecasting of the LULC map, we employed cellular automata (ANN-CA). Expansion of built-up land is the primary source of CO2. From 1990 to 2040, agriculture lost 145 megagram of carbon per hectare (Mg C/ha), whereas vegetation lost 34,948.15 Mg C/ha. Vegetation would get 17,363.7 Mg C/ha during the same period, whereas urban areas would receive 3924.1 Mg C/ha. Approximately 17,000 Mg C/ha would be lost from the vegetation area in future periods. The approaches outlined in this paper may add a new dimension to carbon emission analyses and provide helpful information for low-carbon city.

AB The impact of chemical processes in ocean surface waters is far-reaching. Recently, increased significance has been placed on the concentration of Carbon and its compounds and the effects these may have on climate change. Remote-sensing enables near real-time measurement of key sea-surface data which can be used to estimate Carbon levels. We illustrate with the use of hybrid Satellite sensor data. To validate our results we use data collected from cruise ships as the ground truth when training our algorithms. The error rate of our predictor is found to be small and hence the proposed approach can be used to estimate Carbon levels in any ocean. This work improves upon previous research in many ways including the use of sea water salinity as a proxy for Carbon estimates. Binary combinations of typically unary predictor attributes are used for the purposes of predicting the Carbon content of surface water and an inherently non-linear model is used to quantify the relationship.

AB Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is of great significance since it represents large carbon storage and may reduce global climate change. However, there are still considerable uncertainties in forest AGB estimates, especially in rugged regions, due to the lack of effective algorithms to remove the effects of topography and the lack of comprehensive comparisons of methods used for estimation. Here, we systematically compare the performance of three sources of remote sensing data used in forest AGB estimation, along with three machine-learning algorithms using extensive field measurements (N = 1058) made in the Khingan Mountains of north-eastern China in 2008. The datasets used were obtained from the LiDAR-based Geoscience Laser Altimeter System onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation satellite (ICESat/GLAS), the optical-based Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the SAR-based Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR). We show that terrain correction is effective for this mountainous study region and that the combination of terrain-corrected GLAS and PALSAR features with Random Forest regression produces the best results at the plot scale. Including further MODIS-based features added little power for prediction. Based upon the parsimonious data source combination, we created a map of AGB circa 2008 and its uncertainty, which yields a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.82 and a root mean squared error of 16.84 Mg ha(-1) when validated with field data. Forest AGB values in our study area were within the range 79.81 +/- 16.00 Mg ha(-1), ~25% larger than a previous, SAR-based, analysis. Our result provides a historic benchmark for regional carbon budget estimation.

AB Quantifying fuel load over large areas is essential to support integrated fire management initiatives in fire-prone regions to preserve carbon stock, biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. It also allows a better understanding of global climate regulation as a potential carbon sink or source. Large area assessments usually require data from spaceborne remote sensors, but most of them cannot measure the vertical variability of vegetation structure, which is required for accurately measuring fuel loads and defining management interventions. The recently launched NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) full-waveform lidar sensor holds potential to meet this demand. However, its capability for estimating fuel load has yet not been evaluated. In this study, we developed a novel framework and tested machine learning models for predicting multi-layer fuel load in the Brazilian tropical savanna (i.e., Cerrado biome) using GEDI data. First, lidar data were collected using an unnamed aerial vehicle (UAV). The flights were conducted over selected sample plots in distinct Cerrado vegetation formations (i.e., grassland, savanna, forest) where field measurements were conducted to determine the load of surface, herbaceous, shrubs and small trees, woody fuels and the total fuel load. Subsequently, GEDI-like full-waveforms were simulated from the high-density UAV-lidar 3-D point clouds from which vegetation structure metrics were calculated and correlated to field-derived fuel load components using Random Forest models. From these models, we generate fuel load maps for the entire Cerrado using all on-orbit available GEDI data. Overall, the models had better performance for woody fuels and total fuel loads (R-2 = 0.88 and 0.71, respectively). For components at the lower stratum, models had moderate to low performance (R-2 between 0.15 and 0.46) but still showed reliable results. The presented framework can be extended to other fire-prone regions where accurate measurements of fuel components are needed. We hope this study will contribute to the expansion of spaceborne lidar applications for integrated fire management activities and supporting carbon monitoring initiatives in tropical savannas worldwide.

AB The dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) play a critical role in modulating global warming. However, the long-term spatiotemporal changes of SOC at large scale, and the impacts of driving forces remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the dynamics of SOC in different soil layers across China through the1980s to 2010s using a machine learning approach and quantified the impacts of the key factors based on factorial simulation experiments.Our results showed that the latest (2000-2014) SOC stock in the first meter soil (SOC100) was 80.68 +/- 3.49 Pg C, of which 42.6% was stored in the top 20 cm, sequestrating carbon with a rate of 30.80 +/- 12.37 g C m(-2) yr(-1)since the 1980s. Our experiments focusing on the recent two periods (2000s and 2010s) revealed that climate change exerted the largest relative contributions to SOC dynamics in both layers and warming or drying can result in SOC loss. However, the influence of climate change weakened with soil depth, while the opposite for vegetation growth. Relationships between SOC and forest canopy height further confirmed this strengthened impact of vegetation with soil depth and highlighted the carbon sink function of deep soil in mature forest. Moreover, our estimates suggested that SOC dynamics in 71% of topsoil were controlled by climate change and its coupled influence with environmental variation (CE). Meanwhile, CE and the combined influence of climate change and vegetation growth dominated the SOC dynamics in 82.05% of the first meter soil. Additionally, the national cropland topsoil organic carbon increased with a rate of 23.6 +/- 7.6 g C m(-2) yr(-1)since the 1980s, and the widely applied nitrogenous fertilizer was a key stimulus. Overall, our study extended the knowledge about the dynamics of SOC and deepened our understanding about the impacts of the primary factors.

AB The global ocean is a major sink of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted into the atmosphere. Machine learning has been actively used in the past decades to estimate the oceanic sink, but it is still a challenge to obtain an accurate estimate due to scarcely available CO2 measurements. One of the methods to deal with data scarcity was normalizing multiple years' CO2 values to a reference year to increase the spatial coverage. The practice assumed a constant CO2 trend for the normalization. Here, we used three machine learning models to extract variable ocean CO2 trends on a decadal scale and proposed a method to use the extracted ocean CO2 trends to correct the decadal atmospheric CO2 trends for data normalization. The method minimizes assumptions of using the extracted ocean CO2 trends directly. Comparisons of our CO2 flux estimate with machine learning products included in Global Carbon Budget 2021 indicates that using the variable trends improved the bias resulted from using a constant trend and that the trends are a critical factor for machine learning methods. Our dataset includes monthly distributions of surface ocean CO2 concentration and air-sea flux in 1980-2020 with a spatial resolution of 1x1 degree.

TI Deriving Full-Coverage and Fine-Scale XCO2 Across China Based on OCO-2 Satellite Retrievals and CarbonTracker Output

AB Due to the coarse spatial resolution, the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) data from the CarbonTracker may be inadequate to reflect the spatial heterogeneity of XCO2. We developed a machine learning model to fill the data gaps in the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 satellite retrievals across China during 2015-2018, with cross-validation R-2 = 0.95 and RMSE = 0.91 ppm. Based on the gap-filled data set, the multiyear average XCO2 was the highest in East China (405.71 +/- 3.72 ppm) and the lowest in Northwest China (403.99 +/- 3.47 ppm). At the national level, the multiyear seasonal XCO2 varied from 402.54 +/- 3.95 ppm in summer to 406.28 +/- 3.19 ppm in spring. While the XCO2 kept increasing, the rate of increase declined from 3.23 to 2.10 ppm/year. The machine learning approach is feasible for downscaling and calibrating the CarbonTracker XCO2 data. The full-coverage and fine-scale XCO2 data set is expected to advance our understanding of the carbon cycles.

AB Carbon dioxide storage in underground saline aquifers is considered a promising technique for decreasing atmospheric CO2 emissions. The CO2 residual and solubility in deep saline aquifers are crucial processes for improving CO2 storage security. In this study, the trapping efficiency of CO2 sequestration in saline formations was predicted by developing three supervised machine learning (ML)-based models: random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector regression (SVR). A diverse field-scale simulation database of 1509 samples were collected from the literature, and the proposed models were examined for training and testing. To verify the prediction accuracy of the three ML models, the prediction results were analysed and compared using graphical and statistical indicators. From the prediction results, the proposed ML models were ranked based on their accuracy: XGBoost > RF > SVR. The XGBoost-based predictive model achieved an extremely low root mean square error (RMSE = 0.0041) and high correlation factor (R-2 = 0.9993) for both residual and solubility trapping efficiency. However, RF and SVR exhibited RMSEs of 0.0243 and 0.074 and R-2 values of 0.9781 and 0.9284, respectively. Furthermore, the applicability of the XGBoost model was validated and only 15 suspected data points were detected across the entire database. Therefore, the proposed model can be a valuable and viable template for predicting the CO2 trapping index in other saline formations worldwide. Utimately, the XGBoost model has been tested against reservoir simulation models in comprehensive blind testing and may be used as a robust screening and process planning tool for the uncertainty assessment of carbon storage projects.

AB Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) provides valuable information about the carbon cycle, carbon sink monitoring, and understanding of climate change factors. Remote sensing data coupled with machine learning models have been increasingly used for forest AGB estimation over local and regional extents. Landsat series provide a 50-year data archive, which is a valuable source for historical mapping over large areas. As such, this paper proposed a machine learning-based workflow for historical AGB estimation and its change analysis from 2001 to 2019 for the New York State's forests using Landsat historical imagery, airborne LiDAR, and forest plot data. As the object-based image analysis (OBIA) is able to incorporate spectral, contextual, and textural features into the regression model, the proposed method utilizes an OBIA approach and a random forest (RF) regression model implemented on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Results demonstrated that there is a considerable decrease of 983.79 x 10(6) Mg/ha in the AGB of deciduous forests from 2001 to 2006, followed by an increase of 618.28 x 10(6) Mg/ha from 2006 to 2011, continued with an increase of 229.12 x 10(6) Mg/ha of deciduous forests from 2011-2016. Finally, the results demonstrated a slight change in AGB from 2016 to 2019. The transferability of the proposed framework provides a practical solution for monitoring forests in other states or even on a national scale.

AB Detecting early deforestation is a fundamental process in reducing forest degradation and carbon emissions. With this procedure, it is possible to monitor and control illegal activities associated with deforestation. Most regular monitoring projects have been recently proposed, but most of them rely on optical imagery. In addition, these data are seriously restricted by cloud coverage, especially in tropical environments. In this regard, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an attractive alternative that can fill this observational gap. This work evaluated and compared a conventional method based on time series and a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) with bi-temporal SAR images. These approaches were assessed in two regions of the Brazilian Amazon to detect deforestation between 2019 and 2020. Different pre-processing techniques, including filtering and stabilization stages, were applied to the C-band Sentinel-1 images. Furthermore, this study proposes to provide the network with the distance map to past-deforestation as additional information to the pair of images being compared. In our experiments, this proposal brought up to 4% improvement in average precision. The experimental results further indicated a clear superiority of the DL approach over a time series-based deforestation detection method used as a baseline in all experiments. Finally, the study proved the benefits of pre-processing techniques when using detection methods based on time series. On the contrary, the analysis revealed that the neural network could eliminate noise from the input images, making filtering innocuous and, therefore, unnecessary. On the other hand, the stabilization of the input images brought non-negligible accuracy gains to the DL approach.

AB Atmospheric vapor pressure deficit has worldwide impacts on the interannual variability of terrestrial carbon sinks and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Interannual variability of the terrestrial ecosystem carbon sink is substantially regulated by various environmental variables and highly dominates the interannual variation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. Thus, it is necessary to determine dominating factors affecting the interannual variability of the carbon sink to improve our capability of predicting future terrestrial carbon sinks. Using global datasets derived from machine-learning methods and process-based ecosystem models, this study reveals that the interannual variability of the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) was significantly negatively correlated with net ecosystem production (NEP) and substantially impacted the interannual variability of the atmospheric CO2 growth rate (CGR). Further analyses found widespread constraints of VPD interannual variability on terrestrial gross primary production (GPP), causing VPD to impact NEP and CGR. Partial correlation analysis confirms the persistent and widespread impacts of VPD on terrestrial carbon sinks compared to other environmental variables. Current Earth system models underestimate the interannual variability in VPD and its impacts on GPP and NEP. Our results highlight the importance of VPD for terrestrial carbon sinks in assessing ecosystems' responses to future climate conditions.

DT Article

AB To meet the sustainable development goals and enable sustainable management and protection of peatlands, there is a strong need for improving the mapping of peatlands. Here we present a novel approach to identify peat soils based on a high-resolution digital soil moisture map that was produced by combining airborne laser scanning-derived terrain indices and machine learning to model soil moisture at 2 m spatial resolution across the Swedish landscape. As soil moisture is a key factor in peat formation, we fitted an empirical relationship between the thickness of the organic layer (measured at 5479 soil plots across the country) and the continuous SLU (Swedish University of Agricultural Science) soil moisture map (R-2 = 0.66, p < 0.001). We generated categorical maps of peat occurrence using three different definitions of peat (30, 40, and 50 cm thickness of the organic layer) and a continuous map of organic layer thickness. The predicted peat maps had a higher overall quality (MCC = 0.69-0.73) compared to traditional Quaternary deposits maps (MCC = 0.65) and topographical maps (MCC = 0.61) and captured the peatlands with a recall of ca. 80 % compared to 50 %-70 % on the traditional maps. The predicted peat maps identified more peatland area than previous maps, and the areal coverage estimates fell within the same order as upscaling estimates from national field surveys. Our method was able to identify smaller peatlands resulting in more accurate maps of peat soils, which was not restricted to only large peatlands that can be visually detected from aerial imagery - the historical approach of mapping. We also provided a continuous map of the organic layer, which ranged 6-88 cm organic layer thickness, with an R-2 of 0.67 and RMSE (root mean square error) of 19 cm. The continuous map exhibits a smooth transition of organic layers from mineral soil to peat soils and likely provides a more natural representation of the distribution of soils. The continuous map also provides an intuitive uncertainty estimate in the delineation of peat soils, critically useful for sustainable spatial planning, e.g., greenhouse gas or biodiversity inventories and landscape ecological research.

AB Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is the amount of sequestered CO2 during plant photosynthesis. GPP is an important indicator of ecosystem health in various ecologies and to assess climate change. The objective of the present work is to propose a machine learning based GPP estimation model using remote sensing (RS) data in combination with meteorological data (MET) and topographical data (TOPO) for prediction of GPP, which can be upscaled in temporal and spatial resolution. Random Forest Regression (RFR) is proposed for this using the Fluxnet2015 GPP dataset for the Australian region. This model has attained a very high accuracy with an R2 value of 0.82, as estimated by 10-fold cross-validation. The model has been compared with state-of-the-art machine learning models and found to be performing better than others. Different feature sets like METfeatures and TOPO-features were evaluated in combination with RS-features. The results exhibited that the RFR model performed better when MET and TOPO features are combined with RS-features. GPP prediction for the year 2014, in 8 days temporal and 500m spatial resolution for the Australian region for different plant function types is demonstrated using the proposed model and produced very high value of R2 (0.84), when compared to ground truth. Thus, the proposed approach of the RFR model for GPP estimation showed significant improvement in regional carbon cycle studies and can also be employed for simulating GPP for the future under different climate scenarios.

AB Quantitative assessment of aboveground biomass (AGB) and spatial distribution pattern of exotic mangrove plants (Sonneratia apetala) is of great significance for blue carbon management and ecological restoration in typical subtropical estuaries in China. Although unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has certain advantages in the investigation of the vertical three-dimensional structure of mangroves, the existing mangrove investigation results are mainly based on plot investigation method. Few scholars use machine learning (ML) method to estimate AGB of invasive Sonneratia apetala by combining plot investigation and LiDAR data. Therefore, on the basis of the height and intensity variables of UAV-LiDAR data, this study used four different ML algorithms, namely, xgboost regressor (XGBR), catboost regressor (CBR), light gradient boosting regressor (LGBR) and AdaBoost regressor (ABR), to estimate AGB of invasive mangrove. Then, the quantitative relationship between invasive mangrove biomass and hydrological unit was analysed. We found that CBR model had the highest accuracy in estimation of mangrove AGB (R-2 = 0.7644, RMSE = 11.1725 Mg/ha), followed by XGBR model (R-2 = 0.6759, 13.1053 Mg/ha). However, LGBR model (R-2 = 0.3506, RMSE = 18.5510 Mg/ha) had poor fitting effect. The AGB of invasive mangroves showed a spatial distribution pattern of high in northwest and low in southeast, and its value ranged from 7.31 Mg/ha to 114.04 Mg/ha, with an average of 25.57 Mg/ha. The AGB of invasive mangroves was independent of the area size of the hydrological response unit but depended on the elevation of the beach surface and the distance from the main tidal ditch. This study demonstrates the feasibility of UAV-LiDAR remote sensing and CBR model in estimating AGB of invasive mangrove species, which can provide scientific basis and technical support for the assessment of invasive mangrove ecosystem and the protection of local mangrove tree species.

AB Quantifying forest systems is of importance for ecological services and economic benefits in ecosystem models. This study aims to map the percent tree cover (PTC) of various forest stands in the Buyuk Menderes Basin, located in the western part of Turkey with different characteristics in the Mediterranean and Terrestrial transition regions Sentinel-2 data with 10-m spatial resolution. In recent years, some researches have been carried out in different fields to show the capabilities and potential of Sentinel-2 satellite sensors. However, the limited number of PTC researches conducted with Sentinel-2 images reveals the importance of this study. This study aimed to demonstrate reliable PTC data in landscape planning or ecosystem modeling by introducing an advanced approach with high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution and more cost-effective. In this study, a regression tree algorithm, one of the popular machine learning techniques for ecological modeling, was used to estimate the tree cover's dependent variable based on high-resolution monthly metrics' spectral signatures. Six frames of TripleSat images were used as training data in the regression tree. Monthly Sentinel-2 bands and produced metrics including NDVI, LAI, fCOVER, MSAVI2, and MCARI were almost the first time used as predictor variables. Stepwise linear regression (SLR) was applied to select these predictor bands in the regression tree and a correlation coefficient of 0.83 was obtained. Result PTC maps were produced and the results were evaluated based on coniferous and broadleaf. The results were tested using high spatial resolution TripleSat images and higher model accuracy was determined in both forest types. The high correlation is due to the Sentinel 2 satellite's band characteristics and the metrics are directly related to the tree cover. As a result, the high-accuracy availability of the Sentinel2 satellite is seen to map the PTC on a regional scale, including complex forest types between the Mediterranean and terrestrial transition climates.

AB Tree height is an important parameter for calculating forest carbon sink and assessing forest carbon cycle. In order to obtain forest tree height over a large area both efficiently and at a low cost, this study proposed an Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) combined with a machine learning method to estimate the tree canopy height. The forest height in the study area was obtained using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry, which was considered to be the true canopy height. Two machine learning methods (Random Forest, Multi-layer perceptron) were used to establish the relationship between phase center height calculated by InSAR DEM differential interference method and coherent amplitude method with true canopy height. The topographic factor, backward scattering coefficient and coherence coefficient were introduced into the relationship model. It was found that the accuracy of tree height estimation using random forest and two InSAR methods can reach 0.95 and 0.94. The root-mean-square error was 1.76 m, 1.86 m, respectively. The accuracy of tree height estimation using multi-layer perceptron and two InSAR methods was 0.25 and 0.2. The root-mean-square error was 3.96 m and 4.13 m. The results indicated that the combination of InSAR and machine learning can estimate canopy height efficiently and at a low cost. Moreover, the integrated learning algorithm random forest demonstrated better stability and higher accuracy than the single learning algorithm multi-layer perceptron.

AB Monitoring agricultural soil organic carbon (SOC) has played an essential role in sustainable agricultural management. Precise and robust prediction of SOC greatly contributes to carbon neutrality in the agricultural industry. To create more knowledge regarding the ability of remote sensing to monitor carbon soil, this research devises a state-of-the-art low cost machine learning model for quantifying agricultural soil carbon using active and ensemble-based decision tree learning combined with multi-sensor data fusion at a national and world scale. This work explores the use of Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band dual polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral data, and an innovative machine learning (ML) approach using an integration of active learning for land-use mapping and advanced Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for robustness of the SOC estimates. The collected soil samples from a field survey in Western Australia were used for the model validation. The indicators including the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root - mean - square - error (RMSE) were applied to evaluate the model's performance. A numerous features computed from optical and SAR data fusion were employed to build and test the proposed model performance. The effectiveness of the proposed machine learning model was assessed by comparing with the two well-known algorithms such as Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict agricultural SOC. Results suggest that a combination of S1 and S2 sensors could effectively estimate SOC in farming areas by using ML techniques. Satisfactory accuracy of the proposed XGBoost with optimal features was achieved the highest performance (R-2 = 0.870; RMSE - 1.818 tonC/ha) which outperformed RF and SVM. Thus, multi-sensor data fusion combined with the XGBoost lead to the best prediction results for agricultural SOC at 10 m spatial resolution. In short, this new approach could significantly contribute to various agricultural SOC retrieval studies globally. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Carbon geological sequestration (CGS) in saline aquifers is an effective carbon utilization approach to decrease the effect of greenhouse gases on the atmosphere. However, the GCS project's fundamental problem remains accurate prediction of carbon trapping efficiency in storage formations. As a result, four machine learning (ML) models were explored and compared in this study to improve the prediction of carbon storage performance in saline aquifers. The adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), extra tree (ET), random forest (RF), and radial basis function (RBF) models were used. These were considered for mapping the link between carbon trapping efficiency and influencing factors. A total of 1868 field simulation data points for carbon residual (RTI) and solubility trapping (STI) were extracted from published literature to develop the ML models. The four ML outcomes were assessed and compared using graphical analysis and statistical metrics. The results of the four models, ranked from strongest to weakest, were RF > ANFIS > RBF > ET. The RF scheme achieved the R-2 values of 0.995 and 0.965 and MAE values of 0.0074 and 0.0086 for RTI and STI, respectively. Therefore, an RF robust model is proposed to evaluate the carbon trapping effectiveness in saline aquifers. Simultaneously, the relevancy factor was applied to evaluate the sensitivity of each input parameter. The sensitivity analysis indicated that depth and post injection time were the most influential factors in residual and solubility trapping performance. The findings of this study could help us better understand the potential of ML for predicting carbon trapping efficiencies. The best RF model could serve as a template to quickly predict the performance of carbon storage.

AB Forest disturbances reduce the extent of natural habitats, biodiversity, and carbon sequestered in forests. With the implementation of the international framework Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), it is important to improve the accuracy in the estimation of the extent of forest disturbances. Time series analyses, such as Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST), have been frequently used to map tropical forest disturbances with promising results. Previous studies suggest that in addition to magnitude of change, disturbance accuracy could be enhanced by using other components of BFAST that describe additional aspects of the model, such as its goodness-of-fit, NDVI seasonal variation, temporal trend, historical length of observations and data quality, as well as by using separate thresholds for distinct forest types. The objective of this study is to determine if the BFAST algorithm can benefit from using these model components in a supervised scheme to improve the accuracy to detect forest disturbance. A random forests and support vector machines algorithms were trained and verified using 238 points in three different datasets: all-forest, tropical dry forest, and temperate forest. The results show that the highest accuracy was achieved by the support vector machines algorithm using the all-forest dataset. Although the increase in accuracy of the latter model vs. a magnitude threshold model is small, i.e., 0.14% for sample-based accuracy and 0.71% for area-weighted accuracy, the standard error of the estimated total disturbed forest area was 4352.59 ha smaller, while the annual disturbance rate was also smaller by 1262.2 ha year(-1). The implemented approach can be useful to obtain more precise estimates in forest disturbance, as well as its associated carbon emissions.

AB As the largest component of carbon export from terrestrial ecosystems, ecosystem respiration (RECO), together with vegetation productivity, determines the carbon stock changes in terrestrial ecosystems, so it is crucial to reveal the response of RECO to climate change. However, the simulation of RECO is usually inaccurate due to the neglect of the lagged response of respiration to changes in water conditions. In this study, we integrated meteorological data, remote sensing data, and soil data, and introduced the indicators of the previous water conditions into the deep learning model to simulate RECO. The conclusions are as follows: (a) There is a 1-2 years' lagged response of RECO to changes in water conditions. (b) It is necessary to consider the influence of previous water conditions when simulate RECO. It not only improved the simulation accuracy of RECO, but also reflected its inter-annual fluctuations and change trends more accurately, avoiding the underestimation of RECO inter-annual fluctuations. (c) There is an inconsistency in carbon input and carbon output change trends which impacts the carbon sink pattern and potential of terrestrial ecosystems. The growth trend of Gross Primary Production (GPP) in global terrestrial ecosystems is greater than that of RECO, with a trend of increasing carbon sinks, especially in the northern extra-tropics; while the carbon sink capacity of tropical regions has gradually saturated, showing that the change trend of RECO is close to that of GPP, which poses a potential risk to the sustainable carbon sink capacity of global ecosystems in the future.

AB Forests sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) which is important for climate mitigation. Net ecosystem production (NEP) varies significantly across forests in different regions depending on the dominant tree species, stand age, and environmental factors. Therefore, it is important to evaluate forest NEP and its potential changes under climate change in different regions to inform forestry policy making. Norway spruce (Picea abies) is the most prevalent species in conifer forests throughout Europe. Here, we focused on Norway spruce forests and used eddy covariance-based observations of CO2 fluxes and other variables from eight sites to build a XGBoost machine learning model for NEP estimation. The NEP values from the study sites varied between -296 (source) and 1253 (sink) g C m(-2) yr(-1). Overall, among the tested variables, air temperature was the most important factor driving NEP variations, followed by global radiation and stand age, while precipitation had a very limited contribution to the model. The model was used to predict the NEP of mature Norway spruce forests in different regions within Europe. The NEP median value was 494 g C m(-2) yr(-1) across the study areas, with higher NEP values, up to >800 g C m(-2) yr(-1), in lower latitude regions. Under the "middle-of-the-road" SSP2-4.5 scenario, the NEP values tended to be greater in almost all the studied regions by 2060 with the estimated median of NEP changes in 2041-2060 to be +45 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Our results indicate that Norway spruce forests show high productivity in a wide area of Europe with potentially future NEP enhancement. However, due to the limitations of the data, the potential decrease in NEP induced by temperature increases beyond the photosynthesis optima and frequent ecosystem disturbances (e.g., drought, bark beetle infestation, etc.) still needs to be evaluated.

AB Soil carbon is the largest terrestrial carbon pool. Reliable mapping of soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total carbon content (STC) is essential for agricultural ecosystem management and carbon accounting under global warming conditions. This study was conducted at a fine scale and aimed to perform spatial distribution pre-diction and uncertainty mapping of SOC and STC and quantify the contribution of environmental variables affecting the variability of SOC and STC. Three machine learning models, namely, Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Random Forest plus residuals Kriging (RFRK), were developed using 4345 agricultural topsoil samples and 16 environmental covariates. Mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE), and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC) were used to evaluate the prediction global accuracy. Accuracy plot was used to quantify the uncertainty (i.e. local accuracy) of SOC and STC predictions. RFRK performed best with MAE, RMSE, NSE, and LCCC of 20.76%, 27.61%, 0.39, and 0.56 for SOC and 27.20%, 38.59%, 0.35, and 0.53 for STC, respectively. RF out-performed XGBoost in terms of NSE (0.33 vs 0.29 for SOC and 0.36 vs 0.32 for STC). Accuracy plots showed that RFRK produced higher local accuracy than RF both in quantifying the prediction uncertainty of SOC and STC. XGBoost performed excellently in the uncertainty estimation of SOC. Land use types, mean annual Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and elevation were the top three important indicators in determining the spatial variability of SOC and STC. These results could provide inspiration and support for monitoring soil carbon in complex terrain areas.

AB Rapid and accurate mapping of soil organic carbon (SOC) is of great significance to understanding the spatial patterns of soil fertility and conducting soil carbon cycle research. Previous studies have dedicated considerable efforts to the spatial prediction of SOC content, but few have systematically quantified the effects of environmental covariates selection, the spatial scales and the model types on SOC prediction accuracy. Here, we spatially predicted SOC content through digital soil mapping (DSM) based on 186 topsoil (0-20 cm) samples in a typical hilly red soil region of southern China. Specifically, we first determined an optimal covariate set from different combinations of multiple environmental variables, including multi-sensor remote sensing images (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2), climate variables and DEM derivatives. Furthermore, we evaluated the impacts of spatial resolution (10 m, 30 m, 90 m, 250 m and 1000 m) of covariates and the model types (three linear and three non-linear machine learning techniques) on the SOC prediction. The results of the performance analysis showed that a combination of Sentinel-1/2-derived variables, climate and topographic predictors generated the best predictive performance. Among all variables, remote sensing covariates, especially Sentinel-2-derived predictors, were identified as the most important explanatory variables controlling the variability of SOC content. Moreover, the prediction accuracy declined significantly with the increased spatial scales and achieved the highest using the XGBoost model at 10 m resolution. Notably, non-linear machine learners yielded superior predictive capability in contrast with linear models in predicting SOC. Overall, our findings revealed that the optimal combination of predictor variables, spatial resolution and modeling techniques could considerably improve the prediction accuracy of the SOC content. Particularly, freely accessible Sentinel series satellites showed great potential in high-resolution digital mapping of soil properties.

AB In the current scenario of anthropogenic climate change, carbon credit security is becoming increasingly important worldwide. Topsoil is the terrestrial ecosystem component with the largest carbon sequestration capacity. Since soil organic matter (SOM), which is mostly composed of organic carbon, and can be affected by rainfall, cultivation, and pollutant inflow, predicting SOM content through regular monitoring is necessary to secure a stable carbon sink. In addition, topsoil in the Republic of Korea is vulnerable to erosion due to climate, topography, and natural and anthropogenic causes, which is also a serious issue worldwide. To mitigate topsoil erosion, establish an efficient topsoil management system, and maximize topsoil utilization, it is necessary to construct a database or gather data for the construction of a database of topsoil environmental factors and topsoil composition. Spectroscopic techniques have been used in recent studies to rapidly measure topsoil composition. In this study, we investigated the spectral characteristics of the topsoil from four major rivers in the Republic of Korea and developed a machine learning-based SOM content prediction model using spectroscopic techniques. A total of 138 topsoil samples were collected from the waterfront area and drinking water protection zone of each river. The reflection spectrum was measured under the condition of an exposure time of 136 ms using a spectroradiometer (Fieldspec4, ASD Inc., Alpharetta, GA, USA). The reflection spectrum was measured three times in wavelengths ranging from 350 to 2500 nm. To predict the SOM content, partial least squares regression and support vector regression were used. The performance of each model was evaluated through the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error. The result of the SOM content prediction model for the total topsoil was R-2 = 0.706. Our findings identified the important wavelength of SOM in topsoil using spectroscopic technology and confirmed the predictability of the SOM content. These results could be used for the construction of a national topsoil database.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration is a promising natural climate solution for capturing atmospheric CO2, and it provides crucial co-benefits in improving soil functions and services at the same time. Given that SOC is not a single and uniform entity, a deep understanding of SOC response to environmental changes requires additional information on SOC fractions with distinct characteristics such as particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral associated organic carbon (MAOC). Despite their great importance, POC and MAOC information is still scarce in the soil databases, particularly on a broad scale. Pedotransfer function (PTF) is a good strategy to estimate missing soil properties, while its application in SOC fractions has been poorly explored. Based on 352 representative mineral topsoil samples (0-20 cm) across Europe, we evaluated the potential of MAOC prediction using machine learning based PTF (random forest (RF), Cubist, and gradient boosted machine (GBM)) together with predictor selection methods (recursive feature elimination (RFE) and forward recursive feature selection (FRFS)). The repeated validation (100 times) showed that MAOC could be well predicted by machine learning based PTFs (R2 of 0.877-0.9, RMSE of 2.994-3.269 g kg- 1). RFE can effectively reduce the number of predictors from 21 to 12 with comparable performance to the models using all predictors. The proposed FRFS algorithm had the best model parsimony with only 6 predictors (SOC, silt + clay, nitrogen, nitrogen deposition, soil erosion and sand) and performed similar to or even better than RFE. In combination with FRFS, Cubist performed best among the three machine learning models (R2 of 0.9, RMSE of 2.994 g kg- 1). Our results also showed that five model ensemble methods had similar model performance and can improve model accuracy and robustness compared to a single machine learning model. This study provides a valuable reference for coupling PTF and legacy soil databases to increase the spatial coverage and the performance of machine learning based SOC fraction predictions.

AB Upland soils are the main methane (CH4) biological sink, and may be affected by land-use change. Changes in land uses and soil management affect soil properties that control diffusion of gases, which in combination with microbial activity, determine CH4 flux (fCH(4)) through the soil. Net CH4 fluxes and diffusivity-estimated by the CH4 diffusion coefficient- were measured in three common land uses typical from Pampean plains, South America (natural grassland NG; Eucalyptus globulus Labill. afforestation E; and agricultural land AL: oat, soybean and red clover in successive cultivation) during two years (March 2017-March 2019). Methane fluxes in the soilatmosphere interface were measured using the static chamber technique, and a diffusion model was applied to estimate soil CH4 diffusivity from soil porosity. We aimed to quantify the effect of land use change (both E and AL vs. NG, the reference system) on fCH(4) and gas diffusivity due to changes in the soil parameters. Soils were net sinks in the three land uses, with mean CH4 flux higher in the afforestation, intermediate in the natural grassland and lower in the agricultural land (- 10.99 +/- 5.85, - 8.9 +/- 5.32 and - 4.58 +/- 4.19 ng CH4 m(-2) s(-1), respectively). CH4 fluxes varied significantly through seasons and space coinciding with variations in water-filled pore space and air-filled pore space variables (rho > 0.7 and <-0.7 respectively; p < 0.05). Land-use change metric for methane flux Delta fCH(4) was - 2.1 +/- 3.7 and 4.4 +/- 2.5 for NG-E and NG-AL, respectively, indicating a significant increment in net CH4 uptake when the natural grassland is afforested and a decrease when it was converted to agricultural use. This change was mainly explained by changes in soil physical properties (bulk density, soil water content, WFPS and air filled porosity). In relation to this, soil CH4 diffusion coefficient followed the same pattern as fCH(4) (0.024 +/- 0.011; 0.015 +/- 0.007 and 0.008 +/- 0.007 cm(2) s(-1) for E, NG and AL respectively); and allowed us to recalculate mean CH4 fluxes. Theoretical and in situ measured CH4 fluxes were similar and followed the same patterns across land uses, suggesting the possibility to determine CH4 fluxes by means of simple measures of soil properties (bulk density and soil water content) and soil CH4 gradient concentration.

AB It is important to guarantee the property of biological compatibility when estimating tree biomass of the total and components for carbon accounting under global climate change. The issue was successfully considered in traditional nonlinear regression models, but not for machine learning methods. A new method for approaching the compatibility of tree biomass estimation in ANN (Artificial Neural Network) was developed by using the multi-task loss function, which had the desire features of minimizing residuals and approaching biomass compatibility. The method was tested by two tree species biomass dataset and showed the desired feature. Leave one-out validation results showed that comparing ANN model with simultaneously fitting 7 outputs (stem, bark, branch, leaf, crown, trunk, aboveground) and classical loss function, the RMSE of aboveground estimation (AGB) and the mean absolute relative difference between AGB and the sum of component biomass estimations from the model developed by our new method decreased from 166.864 (kg) to 154.860 (kg) and from 4.757% to 0.071%, respectively for Abies nephrolepis dataset, and from 49.18 (kg) to 33.060 (kg) and from 5.314% to 0.636%, respectively for Acer mono dataset. It provided a trade-off solution for the error accumulation and the compatibility among components and the total estimations when using ANN for tree biomass modelling, and was useful for carbon accounting using machine learning methods.

AB Forest organic layers are important soil carbon pools that can, in the absence of disturbance, accumulate to great depths, especially in lowland areas. Across the Canadian boreal forest, fire is the primary disturbance agent, often limiting organic layer accumulation through the direct consumption of these fuels. Organic layer thickness (OLT) and fuel load (OLFL) are common physical attributes used to characterize these layers, especially for wildland fire science. Understanding the drivers and spatial distribution of these attributes is important to improve predictions of fire behaviour, emissions and effects models. We developed maps of OLT and OLFL using machine learning approaches (weighted K-nearest neighbour and random forests) for the forested region of the province of Alberta, Canada (538, 058 km(2)). The random forests approach was found to be the best approach to model the spatial distribution of these forest floor attributes. A databased of 3, 237 OLT and 594 OLFL plots were used to train the models. The error in our final model, particularly for OLT (5 cm), was relatively close to the variability we would expect to find naturally (3 cm). The dominant tree species was the most important covariate in the models. Age, solar radiation, spatial location, climate variables and surficial geology were also important drivers, although their level of importance varied between tree species and depended on the modelling method that was used.

AB Forests play a vital role in maintaining the global carbon balance. However, globally, forest ecosystems are increasingly threatened by climate change and deforestation in recent years. Monitoring forests, specifically forest biomass is essential for tracking changes in carbon stocks and the global carbon cycle. However, developing countries lack the capacity to actively monitor forest carbon stocks, which ultimately adds uncertainties in estimating country specific contribution to the global carbon emissions. In India, authorities use field-based measurements to estimate biomass, which becomes unfeasible to implement at finer scales due to higher costs. To address this, the present study proposed a framework to monitor above-ground biomass (AGB) at finer scales using open-source satellite data. The framework integrated four machine learning (ML) techniques with field surveys and satellite data to provide continuous spatial estimates of AGB at finer resolution. The application of this framework is exemplified as a case study for a dry deciduous tropical forest in India. The results revealed that for wet season Sentinel-2 satellite data, the Random Forest (adjusted R-2 = 0.91) and Artificial Neural Network (adjusted R-2 = 0.77) ML models were better-suited for estimating AGB in the study area. For dry season satellite data, all the ML models failed to estimate AGB adequately (adjusted R-2 between-0.05 - 0.43). Ensemble analysis of ML predictions not only made the results more reliable, but also quantified spatial uncertainty in the predictions as a metric to identify its robustness.

AB The present study explores the capabilities of advanced machine learning algorithms in predicting the sea -surface pCO(2 )(partial pressure of carbon dioxide) in the open oceans of the Bay of Bengal (BoB). We collect the available observations (outside EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone)) from the cruise tracks and the mooring stations. Due to the paucity of data in the BoB, we attempt to predict pCO(2 )based on the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and the Sea Surface Salinity (SSS). Comparing the MLR, the ANN, and the XGBoost algorithm against a common dataset reveals that the XGBoost performs the best for predicting the sea-surface pCO(2 )in the BoB. Using the satellite-derived SST and SSS, we predict the sea-surface pCO(2) using the XGBoost model and compare the same with the in-situ observations. The model performs satisfactorily, having a correlation of 0.75 and the RMSE of +/- 12.23 mu atm. Further using this model, we emulate the monthly variations in the sea-surface pCO(2) for the central BoB between 2010-2019. Using the satellite data, we show that the central BoB is warming at a rate of 0.0175 ?C per year, whereas the SSS decreases at a rate of-0.0088 PSU per year. The modeled pCO(2 )shows a declination at a rate of -0.4852 mu atm per year. We perform sensitivity experiments to find that the variations in SST and SSS contribute asymptotic to 41% and asymptotic to 37% to the declining trends of the pCO(2 )for the last decade. Seasonal analysis shows that the pre-monsoon season has the highest rate of decrease of the sea-surface pCO(2).

AB China has implemented a series of forestry law, policies, regulations, and afforestation projects since the 1970s. However, their impacts on the spatial and temporal patterns of forests have not been fully assessed yet. The lack of an accurate, high-resolution, and long-term forest disturbance and recovery dataset has impeded this assessment. Here we improved the forest loss and gain detections by integrating the LandTrendr change detection algorithm with the Random Forest (RF) machine-learning method and applied it to assess forest loss and gain patterns in the Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guangxi Provinces of the subtropical vegetation in China. The accuracy evaluation indicated that our approach can adequately detect the spatial and temporal distribution patterns in forest gain and loss, with an overall accuracy of 93% and the Kappa coefficient of 0.89. The forest loss area was 8.30 x 10(4) km(2) in the Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guangxi Provinces during 1986-2019, accounting for 43.52% of total forest area in 1986, while the forest gain area was 20.25 x 10(4) km(2), accounting for 106.19% of total forest area in 1986. Although the interannual variation patterns were similar among three provinces, the forest loss and gain area and the magnitude of change trends were significantly different. Guangxi has the largest forest loss and gain area and increasing trends, followed by Jiangxi, and the least in Zhejiang. The variations in annual forest loss and gain area can be mostly explained by the timelines of major forestry policies and regulations. Our study would provide an applicable method and data for assessing the impacts of forest disturbance events and forestry policies and regulations on the spatial and temporal patterns of forest loss and gain in China, and further contributing to regional and national forest carbon and greenhouse gases budget estimations.

AB An accurate and spatially explicit estimation of biomass is required for sustainable forest management, pre-vention of biodiversity loss, and carbon accounting for climate change mitigation. This study offers a method-ology to generate wall-to-wall aboveground biomass density (AGBD) maps that exclusively relies on open access earth observation (EO) data. Specifically, spaceborne Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR data were fused with Sentinel-1 synthetic-aperture radar, Sentinel-2 multispectral, elevation, and land cover data to produce biomass maps of Australia and the United States for 2020. The gradient boosting machine learning framework was applied to predict AGBD and its uncertainty at the resolutions of 100 m and 200 m. The per-formance of models based on (1) Sentinel-2 imagery and land cover and (2) a combination of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 imagery with elevation and land cover data were compared. The most accurate gradient boosting model was identified using a Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with a 5-fold cross-validation. The Sentinel -2 imagery and land cover data analysis resulted in AGBD estimated with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.61 - 0.71, root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 59 - 86 Mg/ha, and relative root-mean-square error (RMSE%) of 45 - 80%. The accuracy of the models improved with the addition of Sentinel-1 and elevation data: AGBD estimation with R2 of 0.66 - 0.74, RMSE of 55 - 81 Mg/ha, and RMSE% of 41 - 77%. It was found that Sentinel-2 and land cover-derived predictors were the most important in estimating annual AGBD. The proposed method also reduced the saturation effect, which is common in high biomass areas when predicting AGBD using satellite imagery. Prediction maps produced in this study could serve as a baseline for current AGB stocks of forested lands equal to 9.8 Pg and 37.1 Pg in Australia and the United States, respectively. Overall, this research high-lights methodological opportunities for combining open access EO data to yield more accurate and globally applicable AGB maps through data fusion.

AB Despite a rapid development of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) for carbon removal in recent years, the methods for evaluating NBS still have certain gaps. We propose an approach based on a combination of remote sensing data and meteorological variables to reconstruct the spatiotemporal variation of net ecosystem exchange from eddy-covariance stations. A Lagrangian particle dispersion model was used for upscaling satellite images and flux towers. We trained data-driven models based on kernel methods separately for each selected land-cover class. The results suggest that the proposed approach to quantifying carbon exchange on a medium-to-large scale by blending eddy covariance flux data with moderate resolution satellite and weather data provides a set of key advantages over previously deployed methods: (1) scalability, achieved via the validation design based on a separate set of eddy covariance stations; (2) high spatial and temporal resolution thanks to the use of Landsat imagery; and (3) robust and accurate predictions due to improved data quality control, advanced machine learning techniques, and rigorous validation. The machine learning models yielded high cross-validation results. Stratification that uses separate Fluxnet stations for each fold of validation ensures that the models are accurate across the area covered by the Fluxnet sites. Overall, we present here a globally scaled technology for the land sector based on high resolution remote sensing imagery, meteorological variables, and direct carbon flux measurements of eddy covariance flux stations.

AB Estimating forest aboveground biomass (AGB) at large scales and fine spatial resolutions has become increasingly important for greenhouse gas accounting, monitoring, and verification efforts to mitigate climate change. Airborne LiDAR is highly valuable for modeling attributes of forest structure including AGB, yet most LiDAR collections take place at local or regional scales covering irregular, non-contiguous footprints, resulting in a patchwork of different landscape segments at various points in time. Here, as part of a statewide forest carbon assessment for New York State (USA), we addressed common obstacles in leveraging a LiDAR patchwork for AGB mapping at landscape scales, including selection of training data, the investigation of regional or coverage specific patterns in prediction error, and map agreement with field inventory across multiple scales. Three machine learning algorithms and an ensemble model were trained with Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) field measurements, airborne LiDAR, and topographic, climatic, and cadastral geodata. Using a novel set of plot selection criteria and growth adjustments to temporally align LiDAR coverages with FIA measurements, 801 FIA plots were selected with co-located point clouds drawn from a patchwork of 17 leaf-off LiDAR coverages (2014-2019). Our ensemble model was used to produce 30 m AGB prediction surfaces within a predictor-defined area of applicability (98% of LiDAR coverage) and within four vegetated landcover classes. The resulting AGB maps were compared with FIA plot-level and areal estimates at multiple scales of aggregation. Our model was overall accurate (% root mean squared error 22%-45%; mean absolute error 11.6-29.4 Mg ha(-1); mean error 2.4-6.3 Mg ha(-1)), explained 73%-80% of field-observed variation, and yielded estimates that were largely consistent with FIA's design-based estimates (89% of estimates within FIA's 95% confidence interval). We share practical solutions to challenges faced in using spatiotemporal patchworks of LiDAR to meet growing needs for AGB prediction and mapping in support of broad-scale applications in forest
