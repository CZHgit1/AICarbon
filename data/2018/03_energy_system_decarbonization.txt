AB With the widespread application of distributed renewable energy in power systems, energy management problems in micro-grids have become increasingly significant. Offline or static optimization methods are frequently employed to solve the problems which are typically discrete and nonlinear. There are few online optimization methods and they are not only complex but also normally consider the distributed generations and loads in micro-grid as a whole. The outcome is that the online methods fail to reflect the composing characteristic of distributed multi-energy and the contribution made by developing renewable energy to reduce the consumption of traditional fossil energy. Moreover, results obtained by either the offline or the on-line methods can deviate to certain extents from the true values. This paper treats the management of distributed energy in micro-grids as an optimal control problem. Using the system control theory, a framework of real-time management of distributed energy in micro grids is proposed. A deep learning adaptive dynamic programming is proposed for this framework. Due to the introduction of the concept of closed-loop feedback, the proposed management and control strategy is a real-time algorithm. Furthermore, the accuracy of managing and controlling the objective function can be improved. The gap of the flexible load after the optimization can be helpful in terms of guiding the flexible load consumers to change their habits of energy consumption, thereby reducing the coal-fired power generation and providing room for reducing carbon emissions. Because it is real-time, micro-grid operators can also realize intra-day scheduling, which can be done through combining this optimized management and control strategy with the mechanism of energy operating and managing. Moreover, some data sets of the real-time optimal control strategy are obtained in this paper. These intuitive and accurate data sets can be used to further optimize energy operating and managing of micro grids, thereby realizing effective energy management for micro-grids. Finally, the real-time and effectiveness of the proposed management and control strategy are proved by the simulations. Some positive conclusions are drawn. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Green Vehicle Routing Optimization Problem (GVROP) is currently a scientific research problem that takes into account the environmental impact and resource efficiency. Therefore, the optimal allocation of resources and the carbon emission in GVROP are becoming more and more important. In order to improve the delivery efficiency and reduce the cost of distribution requirements through intelligent optimization method, a novel multiobjective hybrid quantum immune algorithm based on cloud model (C-HQIA) is put forward. Simultaneously, the computational results have proved that the C-HQIA is an efficient algorithm for the GVROP. We also found that the parameter optimization of the C-HQIA is related to the types of artificial intelligence algorithms. Consequently, the GVROP and the C-HQIA have important theoretical and practical significance.

AB This study applies big data mining, machine learning analysis technique and uses the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) as a tool to discuss the convenience stores energy consumption performance in Taiwan which consists of (a). Influential factors of architectural space environment and geographical conditions; (b). Influential factors of management type; (c). Influential factors of business equipment; (d). Influential factors of local climatic conditions; (e). Influential factors of service area socioeconomic conditions. The survey data of 1,052 chain convenience stores belong to 7-Eleven, Family Mart and Hi-Life groups by Taiwan Architecture and Building Center (TABC) in 2014. The implicit knowledge will be explored in order to improve the traditional analysis technique which is unlikely to build a model for complex, inexact and uncertain dynamic energy consumption system for convenience stores. The analysis process comprises of (a). Problem definition and objective setting; (b). Data source selection; (c). Data collection; (d). Data preprocessing/preparation; (e). Data attributes selection; (f). Data mining and model construction; (g). Results analysis and evaluation; (h). Knowledge discovery and dissemination. The key factors influencing the convenience stores energy consumption and the influence intensity order can be explored by data attributes selection. The numerical prediction model for energy consumption is built by applying regression analysis and classification techniques. The optimization thresholds of various influential factors are obtained. The different cluster data are compared by using clustering analysis to verify the correlation between the factors influencing the convenience stores energy consumption characteristic. The implicit knowledge of energy consumption characteristic obtained by the aforesaid analysis can be used to (a). Provide the owners with accurate predicted energy consumption performance to optimize architectural space, business equipment and operations management mode; (b). The design planners can obtain the optimum design proposal of Cost Performance Ratio (C/P) by planning the thresholds of various key factors and the validation of prediction model; (c). Provide decision support for government energy and environment departments, to make energy saving and carbon emission reduction policies, in order to estimate and set the energy consumption scenarios of convenience store industry.

AB The linkage between energy resources and economic development is a topic of great interest. Research in this area is also motivated by contemporary concerns about global climate change, carbon emissions fluctuating crude oil prices, and the security of energy supply. The purpose of this research is to develop and apply the machine learning approach to predict gross domestic product (GDP) based on the mix of energy resources. Our results indicate that GDP predictive accuracy can be improved slightly by applying a machine learning approach. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
