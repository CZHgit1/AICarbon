AB Assessing the energy consumption of urban buildings is critical for managing city carbon emissions. Given the large number of urban buildings, it is essential to identify the stock of urban prototype buildings. However, current research faces challenges in linking building feature identification with energy consumption evaluation, highlighting the need for methods that improve the functional and spatial coverage of building identification. We developed a comprehensive dataset of urban building footprints and proposed a hybrid approach combining poin of interest identification and machine learning to classify the functions of urban buildings. In addition, we identified the construction year and scale of buildings, analyzing the stock and spatial distribution of 15 types of prototype buildings. The results show that our hybrid method performs well in identifying 22 different building functions, with an overall classification accuracy of 0.86 for the machine learning component. The analysis of prototype building stock reveals that residential buildings are primarily low-rise and multi-story, while public buildings are dominated by offices and schools. Buildings from different periods exhibit distinct spatial distribution patterns. Our study provides a data foundation for evaluating building energy consumption at the urban scale, supporting sustainable urban management efforts.

AB With the increasing integration of renewable energy and smart technologies in residential energy systems, proactive household energy management (HEM) have become critical for reducing costs, enhancing grid stability, and achieving sustainability goals. This study proposes a ultra-short-term forecasting-driven proactive energy consumption optimization strategy that integrates advanced forecasting models with multi-objective scheduling algorithms. By leveraging deep learning techniques like Graph Attention Network (GAT) architectures, the system predicts ultra-short-term household load profiles with high accuracy, addressing the volatility of residential energy use. Then, based on the predicted data, a comprehensive consideration of electricity costs, user comfort, carbon emission pricing, and grid load balance indicators is undertaken. This study proposes an enhanced mixed-integer optimization algorithm to collaboratively optimize multiple objective functions, thereby refining appliance scheduling, energy storage utilization, and grid interaction. Case studies demonstrate that integrating photovoltaic (PV) power generation forecasting and load forecasting models into a home energy management system, and adjusting the original power usage schedule based on predicted PV output and water heater demand, can effectively reduce electricity costs and carbon emissions without compromising user engagement in optimization. This approach helps promote energy-saving and low-carbon electricity consumption habits among users.

AB Efficient large-scale monitoring of methane emissions is crucial for sustainable environmental management, necessitating advanced remote sensing techniques that process hyperspectral imagery to provide detailed insights into the Earth's surface and atmosphere. This technology is vital for identifying methane plumes from point sources within the fossil fuel industry, essential for mitigating climate change and minimizing environmental degradation. Despite advancements, current remote sensing methods often generate significant false alarms that require manual verification by experts, limiting scalability and practicality. To overcome these challenges, our study introduces a novel hybrid model combining a matched filter with the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a foundation model renowned for its zero-shot generalization capabilities. This model efficiently segments methane plumes from hyperspectral images without additional training on customized datasets, streamlining the detection process and enhancing both efficiency and scalability. Additionally, we have developed an iterative scheme to refine methane signatures and improve anomaly detection accuracy. This approach addresses the challenge of acquiring data for cold-start segmentation and reduces the computational burden of training on specialized datasets. The combined capabilities of our methodology not only make it cost-effective but also robust for sensor-agnostic implementation. By leveraging remote sensing and cutting-edge machine learning, our method improves the precision and reliability of environmental monitoring, crucial for advancing global environmental management and sustainability efforts.

AB Global climate change necessitates an immediate reduction in carbon emissions. This study aimed to categorize rail transit energy consumption factors into "traction energy consumption" and "non-traction comprehensive energy consumption" by employing a bottom-up approach and using a sample of urban rail transit operations in 122 Chinese cities from 2018 to 2022. The factors were grouped based on the scale of the urban rail transit network, and planned indicators were screened using stepwise regression and machine learning eigenvalue methods. Predictive models were then constructed using these planned indicators through multiple linear regression and random forest regression. This process yielded five traction energy consumption prediction models corresponding to different network scales as well as one non-traction comprehensive energy consumption prediction model. The applicability of these models was determined through comparison. Additionally, a direct linear relationship between the planned indicators and urban rail transit energy consumption was established using multiple linear regression. This study provides solid support for accurately predicting the energy consumption of urban rail transit operations and optimizing resource allocation. It offers valuable insights for carbon accounting and related research endeavors.

AB Designing energy-efficient buildings is essential for reducing global energy consumption and carbon emissions. However, traditional physics-based simulation models require substantial computational resources, detailed input data, and domain expertise. To address these limitations, this study investigates the use of three machine learning-based surrogate models-Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-trained on a synthetic dataset of 2000 EnergyPlus-simulated building design scenarios to predict both energy use intensity (EUI) and cost estimates for midrise apartment buildings in the Toronto area. All three models exhibit strong predictive performance, with R2 values exceeding 0.9 for both EUI and cost. XGBoost achieves the best performance in cost prediction on the testing dataset with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 5.13 CAD/m2, while MLP outperforms others in EUI prediction with a testing RMSE of 0.002 GJ/m2. In terms of computational efficiency, the surrogate models significantly outperform a physics-based simulation model, with MLP running approximately 340 times faster and XGBoost and RF achieving over 200 times speedup. This study also examines the effect of training dataset size on model performance, identifying a point of diminishing returns where further increases in data size yield minimal accuracy gains but substantially higher training times. To enhance model interpretability, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is used to quantify feature importance, revealing how different model types prioritize design parameters. A parametric design configuration analysis further evaluates the models' sensitivity to changes in building envelope features. Overall, the findings demonstrate that machine learning-based surrogate models can serve as fast, accurate, and interpretable alternatives to traditional simulation methods, supporting efficient decision-making during early-stage building design.

AB As the dual carbon goals are being approached, there has been an increase in the number of energy-saving renovation projects for existing buildings. However, building renovation also brings about environmental impacts and incremental costs, which need to be addressed urgently. This study proposes an integrated artificial intelligence framework to facilitate multi-criteria energy renovation decision making by combining a surrogate-based machine learning (ML) model and an evolutionary generative algorithm to efficiently and accurately identify optimal renovation strategies. To enhance the robustness of the methodology, a comparative analysis of four different ML models-light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), fast random forest (FRF), multivariate linear regression (MVLR), and artificial neural network (ANN)-was conducted, with LightGBM demonstrating the best performance in terms of accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency. Using the heuristic optimization algorithm and entropy-weighted method, the framework achieved average energy savings of 56.62%, a reduction in carbon emissions of 51.60%, and a 24.27% decrease in life-cycle costs. Compared to local ultra-low-energy building standards, the optimal solutions resulted in a 2.60% reduction in carbon emissions and a 15.85% decrease in life-cycle costs. This integrated framework demonstrates the potential of combining machine learning surrogate models, evolutionary generation, and entropy-weighted methods in building energy retrofitting optimizations, offering a novel, efficient, and adaptable approach for researchers and practitioners seeking to balance energy consumption, carbon emissions, and life-cycle costs in renovation projects.

AB The subjectivity of building management and the lack of human-machine interaction make building operation decarbonization challenging. This work designs a building control-oriented optimization framework to reduce carbon emissions and automatically produce the strategies. Firstly, building information modeling is constructed by referring to on-site data and weather conditions to create a multi-condition dataset. Secondly, the surrogate models regarding carbon emissions and thermal comforts correspond to 22-30 degrees C, 30-35 degrees C, and above 35 degrees C during the hot season. Thirdly, the optimal decarbonization strategy under different weather conditions is identified by deep reinforcement learning. Finally, a human-machine interactive interface is developed to display the results and provide valuable suggestions. The proposed decarbonization framework has been validated in a green building in China, and the results reveal that: (1) The building information model can accurately simulate actual carbon emissions with an error of 0.1%. (2) The surrogate models show excellent prediction for carbon emissions and thermal comforts with an R2 of 0.93 in the testing sets. (3) The optimization rates corresponding to 22-30 degrees C, 30-35 degrees C, and above 35 degrees C are 47.28%, 17.75%, and 13.58%, respectively, and the decarbonization-based LLM can provide practical strategy according to outdoor temperature and user preferences. The work contributes to weather-based building control optimization and the development of a building decarbonization large language interaction model.

AB This research addresses the significant greenhouse gas emissions from the construction sector by focusing on the power consumption of office buildings in Taiwan. It introduces an innovative framework combining Building Information Modeling (BIM) and machine learning (ML) to enhance energy intelligence. A primary objective of this study is the development of the TaiBIM_EnergyOffice dataset using BIM. This dataset, a comprehensive repository of energy consumption patterns specific to typical Taiwanese office buildings, addresses key variables such as architectural configurations, material specifications, and environmental conditions to ensure the factors influencing energy consumption are holistically represented. Using the TaiBIM_EnergyOffice data, ML-driven predictions of annual electricity consumption were generated. Among the models tested, the hybrid FBI_BA models outperformed others, achieving an R2 value of 0.944 and a mean absolute percentage error of 3.45%. These results validate the framework's effectiveness in providing actionable insights for operational cost evaluation and environmental impact assessment. This study addresses critical gaps in the availability of region- specific datasets and advances the integration of BIM with ML for energy prediction. This integration overcomes the computational limitations of simulation tools and provides rapid, scalable, and insightful energy consumption predictions. By bridging static BIM data with dynamic energy modeling, the framework enhances energy intelligence while supporting the broader goal of reducing environmental impact through energy-efficient building practices in Taiwan.

AB Energy consumption in buildings is steadily increasing, leading to higher carbon emissions. Predicting energy consumption is a key factor in addressing climate change. There has been a significant shift from traditional statistical models to advanced deep learning (DL) techniques for predicting energy use in buildings. However, data scarcity in newly constructed or poorly instrumented buildings limits the effectiveness of standard DL approaches. In this study, we investigate the application of six data-centric Transfer Learning (TL) strategies on three Transformer architectures-vanilla Transformer, Informer, and PatchTST-to enhance building energy consumption forecasting. Transformers, a relatively new DL framework, have demonstrated significant promise in various domains; yet, prior TL research has often focused on either a single data-centric strategy or older models such as Recurrent Neural Networks. Using 16 diverse datasets from the Building Data Genome Project 2, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis under varying feature spaces (e.g., recorded ambient weather) and building characteristics (e.g., dataset volume). Our experiments show that combining multiple source datasets under a zero-shot setup reduces the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the vanilla Transformer model by an average of 15.9% for 24 h forecasts, compared to single-source baselines. Further fine-tuning these multi-source models with target- domain data yields an additional 3-5 % improvement. Notably, PatchTST outperforms the vanilla Transformer and Informer models. Overall, our results underscore the potential of combining Transformer architectures with TL techniques to enhance building energy consumption forecasting accuracy. However, careful selection of the TL strategy and attention to feature space compatibility are needed to maximize forecasting gains.

AB Featured Application The nUBEM model offers a powerful AI-driven framework for evaluating the energy performance and greenhouse gas emissions of residential buildings on a national scale. By enabling urban and nationwide insights, it supports comprehensive analysis of building characteristics and energy performance across residential building stock. This model is useful for the design of targeted energy efficiency policies and assessing their effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Abstract To effectively decarbonize Europe's building stock, it is crucial to monitor the progress of energy consumption and the associated emissions. This study addresses the challenge by developing a national-scale urban building energy model (nUBEM) using artificial intelligence to predict non-renewable primary energy consumption and associated GHG emissions for residential buildings. Applied to the case study of Spain, the nUBEM leverages open data from energy performance certificates (EPCs), cadastral records, INSPIRE cadastre data, digital terrain models (DTM), and national statistics, all aligned with European directives, ensuring adaptability across EU member states with similar open data frameworks. Using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm, the model analyzes the physical and geometrical characteristics of residential buildings in Spain. Our findings indicate that the XGBoost algorithm outperforms other techniques estimating building-level energy consumption and emissions. The nUBEM offers granular information on energy performance building-by-building related to their physical and geometrical characteristics. The results achieved surpass those of previous studies, demonstrating the model's accuracy and potential impact. The nUBEM is a powerful tool for analyzing residential building stock and supporting data-driven decarbonization strategies. By providing reliable progress indicators for renovation policies, the methodology enhances compliance with EU directives and offers a scalable framework for monitoring decarbonization progress across Europe.

AB We propose a modeling framework that incorporates a combination of configuration effects, fixed effects, and deep learning models to explore the impact of non-high-carbon emission pathways on urban energy transition. In the configuration identification stage, the dynamic qualitative comparative analysis (DQCA) method extracts the configuration pathways of the 'economy-energy-environment' complex system that lead to both high and nonhigh carbon emissions. In the analysis stage, the fixed effects model identifies valuable configurations and addresses temporal heterogeneity. In the prediction stage, we employ a deep learning model based on a spatiotemporal convolutional network and a frequency-enhanced channel attention mechanism-TCN-FECAMMtransformer-to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method quantifies the contributions of configuration conditioning variables and other factors to the predictions made by the TCN-FECAM-Mtransformer model; the results show that there are six pathways within the 'economy-energy-environment' complex system for realizing non-high-carbon emissions. Fixed effects models significantly improve predictive accuracy, with the TCN-FECAM-Mtransformer model outperforming traditional machine learning and deep learning models. SHAP analysis indicates that population size (32.90 %), forest cover (32.50 %), energy production (6.30 %), and energy consumption (5.10 %) have significant impacts on the energy transition. The framework demonstrates high accuracy, making it a valuable reference for formulating relevant policies.

AB This research focuses on optimizing the microenvironment parameters of Chinese courtyard buildings in response to urbanization and climate change. Two particle swarm optimization-based approaches were used: multiobjective optimization and hybrid soft computing frameworks. These methods aimed to enhance human comfort and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using building performance simulation, outdoor thermal parameters were estimated, including the universal thermal climate index, GHG emissions, and discomfort hours. Results showed varied outcomes across cities, with Hangzhou improving outdoor comfort but with poorer indoor comfort, while other cities like Wuhan and Chengdu exhibited different optimal values for GHG emissions and comfort.

AB Forecasting energy has become crucial in modern power systems to ensure efficient operation. Enhanced forecasting tools enable accurate prediction of load and energy demand well in advance, ensuring system reliability. This study focuses on predicting the energy demands of educational institutions, employing various models such as neural networks, support vector machines, ensemble methods, and machine learning algorithms. Using real-time energy data from an educational institute in Hyderabad, consisting of nearly 8760 data points (365*24), forecasting models were trained. The performance of each model was evaluated using R metrics including mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean squared error (MSE), root-mean-squared error, and R-squared (R2). Among the eight models developed, the random forest regression model exhibited superior accuracy with the lowest R metrics values. For the random forest regression model, the metrics were as follows: MSE 0.053, MAE 0.117, MAPE 0.0281, and R2 score 0.9995. This model was trained with four input features (hours, temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity) and one output (energy). Utilizing this model, energy predictions can be made for any day, hour, month, or year. Furthermore, the predicted energy data from the model were employed in the modeling of hybrid renewable energy sources (HRE) systems to satisfy the building's power demands. A techno-economic feasibility analysis of the hybrid renewable energy (HRE) system was conducted, optimizing the PV and wind sources to 133 kW and 1 kW, respectively. This resulted in a minimum cost of energy (COE) of 0.009 USD and an 81% reduction in CO2 emissions.

AB The rapid development of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has raised concerns about device security and energy consumption. The widespread presence of buffer overflow (BOF) vulnerabilities in IoT devices not only threatens devices but also leads to increased carbon emissions. Traditional static analysis methods suffer from low accuracy and high costs. Mainstream binary code similarity detection (BCSD) methods are mainly based on control flow graphs (CFGs) or instructions, which often fail to effectively capture semantic information. In this article, we propose Boreas, a semantic-aware BOF vulnerability detection framework to reduce the carbon footprint in IoT devices. The abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to achieve precise semantic representation of multiarchitecture code. By considering the often-overlooked implicit data receiving points, Boreas comprehensively locates vulnerable binaries in firmware. By leveraging backward reaching definition analysis, Boreas removes extensive code irrelevant to BOF to simplify ASTs, enables cross-function/file detection and enhances interpretability for BCSD. Additionally, we develop a deep learning model AST-BERT for BCSD, which effectively transforms simplified ASTs into vectors. Based on the distance between target and vulnerable vectors, the accurate BOF detection is achieved. To evaluate the performance of Boreas, we construct a large-scale dataset containing real-world IoT firmware. Experiments show that Boreas outperforms state-of-the-art BCSD methods with the precision of 87.08% and leading static analysis tools with the F1-score of 88.81% in vulnerability detection. Finally, Boreas successfully discovers ten unknown critical vulnerabilities, all of which have been recognized by common vulnerabilities and exposure and covered by media.

AB Buildings are a major cause of carbon emissions. The building sector is responsible for around 40% of energy consumption and for about 30% of CO2 emissions. Building Energy Management Systems (BEMS) are crucial for enhancing energy efficiency, and energy flexibility, and mitigating the environmental impact of buildings, which account for a significant amount of global energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. This study addresses the limitations of traditional BEMS by proposing a cloud-based IoT-BEMS with an intuitive user interface and advanced machine learning algorithms for energy optimization. The system integrates demand-side management techniques, including two main principles, load shifting through demand response and energy efficiency, allowing users to control appliances without requiring technical expertise. The results demonstrate significant energy savings, particularly in water heater optimization, with an average reduction of 24.23 % in energy consumption. Additionally, the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm used for electric vehicle (EV) charging resulted in an average cost saving of 30.6% by leveraging off-peak electricity rates. The platform's real-time data processing and user-friendly interface make it a robust solution for residential energy management, effectively balancing energy savings with user comfort. This research underscores the potential of IoT and machine learning in revolutionizing building energy management, contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals.

AB This study proposes a Transformer-NSGA-III multi-objective optimization framework for high-rise residential buildings in Haikou, a coastal city characterized by a hot summer and warm winter climate. The framework addresses four conflicting objectives: Annual Energy Demand (AED), Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD), Global Cost (GC), and Life Cycle Carbon (LCC) emissions. A localized database of 11 design variables was constructed by incorporating envelope parameters and climate data from 79 surveyed buildings. A total of 5000 training samples were generated through EnergyPlus simulations, employing jEPlus and Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS). A Transformer model was employed as a surrogate predictor, leveraging its self-attention mechanism to capture complex, long-range dependencies and achieving superior predictive accuracy (R2 >= 0.998, MAPE <= 0.26%) over the benchmark CNN and MLP models. The NSGA-III algorithm subsequently conducted a global optimization of the four-objective space, with the Pareto-optimal solution identified using the TOPSIS multi-criteria decision-making method. The optimization resulted in significant reductions of 28.5% in the AED, 24.1% in the PPD, 20.6% in the GC, and 18.0% in the LCC compared to the base case. The synergistic control of the window solar heat gain coefficient and external sunshade length was identified as the central strategy for simultaneously reducing energy consumption, thermal discomfort, cost, and carbon emissions in this hot and humid climate. The TOPSIS-optimal solution (C = 0.647) effectively balanced low energy use, high thermal comfort, low cost, and low carbon emissions. By integrating the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) Global Cost methodology with Life Cycle Carbon accounting, this study provides a robust framework for dynamic economic-environmental trade-off analyses of ultra-low-energy buildings in humid regions. The work advances the synergy between the NSGA-III and Transformer models for high-dimensional building performance optimization.

AB Global climate change is one of the major environmental challenges faced today, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is the primary cause of global warming. Although many countries have committed to reducing carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality, progress in reducing emissions across various industries remains uncertain. To address this issue, this study employs advanced machine learning methods such as random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and stacked regression to construct a dynamic correlation model for exploring the relationship between sectoral electricity consumption and urban average CO2 column concentration (XCO2). By combining time-rolling window techniques, the model dynamically reveals temporal correlations between sector-specific electricity consumption and urban XCO2. The performance of the dynamic correlation model was validated with sectoral electricity consumption and urban XCO2 data from 16 cities between 2017 and 2021. The model achieved a coefficient of determination (R2) of up to 0.864 and an root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.350. The study revealed that the model significantly outperformed the traditional random forest and XGBoost models in terms of prediction accuracy, effectively capturing the complex relationship between sectoral electricity consumption and carbon concentration. The correlation between electricity consumption in different industries and XCO2 exhibited significant temporal fluctuations across cities. Through time-rolling analysis, the study revealed sector-specific influences, providing valuable insights for developing more precise and industry-targeted carbon reduction policies.

AB Traffic congestion and carbon emissions remain pressing challenges in urban mobility. This study explores the integration of UAV (drone)-based monitoring systems and IoT sensors, modeled as induction loops, with Large Language Models (LLMs) to optimize traffic flow. Using the SUMO simulator, we conducted experiments in three urban scenarios: Pacific Beach and Coronado in San Diego, and Arguelles in Madrid. A Gemini-2.0-Flash experimental LLM was interfaced with the simulation to dynamically adjust vehicle speeds based on real-time traffic conditions. Comparative results indicate that the AI-assisted approach significantly reduces congestion and CO2 emissions compared to a baseline simulation without AI intervention. This research highlights the potential of UAV-enhanced IoT frameworks for adaptive, scalable traffic management, aligning with the future of drone-assisted urban mobility solutions.

AB This study presents a machine learning-based optimization framework for utility systems in large-scale manufacturing operations. Designed for broad applicability across diverse industrial processes, the framework integrates historical operational and utility data to support energy-efficient decision-making. Three case studies were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the framework. The first case involved identifying feasible operating regions from high-resolution data to optimize utility production in a plant-level utility system. Through this, utility consumption was reduced by 2 %-11 %, resulting in economic efficiency improvements ranging from 6 % to 10 %. The associated reductions in greenhouse gas emissions were also estimated using a life cycle assessment database. The second case applied representation learning techniques to evaluate the optimality of current process operations by comparing them with similar historical instances, offering operational guidance based on data-driven similarity analysis. The third case focused on data storage optimization, where transformation of industrial datasets led to approximately 140-fold reduction in data volume, with implications for integration with image-based AI systems. Together, these case studies demonstrate the potential of machine learning techniques to reduce energy usage, enhance economic performance, and improve data handling in complex manufacturing environments.

AB Data centers are increasingly using more energy due to the rise in Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads, which negatively impacts the environment and raises operational costs. Reducing operating expenses and carbon emissions while maintaining performance in data centers is a challenging problem. This work introduces a unique approach combining Game Theory (GT) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for optimizing the distribution of AI inference workloads in geo-distributed data centers to reduce carbon emissions and cloud operating (energy + data transfer) costs. The proposed technique integrates the principles of non-cooperative Game Theory into a DRL framework, enabling data centers to make intelligent decisions regarding workload allocation while considering the heterogeneity of hardware resources, the dynamic nature of electricity prices, inter-data center data transfer costs, and carbon footprints. We conducted extensive experiments comparing our game-theoretic DRL (GT-DRL) approach with current DRL-based and other optimization techniques. The results demonstrate that our strategy outperforms the state-of-the-art in reducing carbon emissions and minimizing cloud operating costs without compromising computational performance. This work has significant implications for achieving sustainability and cost-efficiency in data centers handling AI inference workloads across diverse geographic locations.

AB An accurate assessment of shale gas resources is highly important for the sustainable development of these energy resources. Total organic carbon (TOC) analysis thus becomes fundamental for understanding the distribution and quality of hydrocarbon source rocks within a shale gas reservoir. The elevation of the TOC is often associated with the presence of source rocks, indicating the potential for oil and gas production. TOC assessment is performed using laboratory methods, which can be time-consuming and costly. Data-driven models have been successfully applied to model the relationship between TOC and other constituents and to predict the TOC content. However, these methods depend on extensive parameter adjustments that must be carefully conducted in different sedimentary environments. In this context, Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) is an alternative for accurately predicting TOCs, saving time-consuming fine-tuning steps in model development. This study aims to develop an AutoML strategy for estimating TOC using well log data. This procedure automatically preprocesses the search for the best method parameters, reducing the execution time. Among the methods evaluated, Extremely Randomized Trees (XT) performed best (R = 0.8632, MSE = 0.1806) in the test set. The proposed strategy provides a powerful data-driven method, which allows real-world use of the well to assist in data analysis and subsequent decision-making.

AB Nigeria faces critical challenges in managing electricity demand peaks and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, underscoring the urgent need for a rapid, sustainable energy transition. This study offers long-term policy guidance aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG-7) to address electricity shortfalls and reduce carbon emissions. By integrating deep learning models, Strengths-Weaknesses-Opportunities-Threats (SWOT) analysis, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and the Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy-TOPSIS), this research evaluates Nigeria's energy transition from economic, environmental, and policy perspectives. Scenario mapping explores four energy mixes: Scenario 1 (27.5 % renewable energy [RE], 72.5 % non-renewable energy [NRE]), Scenario 2 (35 % RE, 65 % NRE), Scenario 3 (50 % RE, 50 % NRE), and Scenario 4 (100 % RE). The proposed hybrid deep learning model demonstrates superior predictive accuracy, achieving an R2 of 0.99, 0.80, and 0.24 across 1-h, 1-day, and 1-week forecasts, respectively. Scenario 2 achieves a total annual cost (TAC) of US$106 million, a significant 51.5 % reduction compared to the most capital-intensive Scenario 4, which has a TAC of US$219 million. Scenario 2 also produces 27.9m kgCO2 emissions, representing a 0.79 % reduction from Scenario 1's highest emissions of 28.1m kgCO2. Furthermore, Scenario 2 offers a cost of energy of 0.0029 kWhUS$- 1, reflecting a 12.1 % improvement in economic efficiency over Scenario 1. Subsequently, the integrated SWOT-AHP approach identified strategies to enhance Nigeria's RE transition across geopolitical zones. Thus, the proposed long-term policy guidance framework can serve as a tool to accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy future while addressing its energy shortfall.

AB As global efforts to combat climate change intensify, transitioning to sustainable transportation is crucial. This study investigates decarbonization strategies for urban traffic in downtown Toronto through microsimulation, focusing on eco-routing and eco-driving strategies, as well as the adoption of different fuel technologies: Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs), and conventional vehicles. A total of 140 scenarios are analyzed, incorporating varying levels of Connected and Automated Vehicle (CAV) penetration, anticipatory routing strategies, and driving behavior. Using transformer-based prediction models, the study evaluates Greenhouse Gas (GHG) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions, average speed, and travel time. The findings demonstrate that 100% BEV adoption can reduce GHG emissions by 75%, but infrastructure and cost challenges persist. HEVs achieve moderate GHG reductions of 35%-40%, while e-fuels offer limited reductions of 5%. The study also highlights the role of ecorouting and eco-driving strategies in reducing emissions and improving travel time. However, it acknowledges potential unintended consequences, including modal shifts from active and public transportation to EVs, which could increase Vehicle Kilometers Traveled (VKT) and congestion, potentially offsetting some benefits of vehicle electrification. Integrating CAVs with anticipatory routing shows additional gains in reducing emissions and optimizing traffic flows. By providing a comprehensive evaluation of fuel technologies, traffic management strategies, and driving behaviors, this study offers actionable insights for policymakers to balance the benefits of electrification with its broader transportation impacts, supporting the development of sustainable urban mobility systems.

TI Leveraging spatial data infrastructure for machine learning based building energy performance prediction
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB The calculation, management and maintenance of energy performance of buildings (EPBs) are significant in increasing energy efficiency in buildings and reducing greenhouse gas emissions since it is estimated that approximately one third of energy consumption is associated with buildings, and furthermore, three-quarters of the existing building stock is characterized by energy inefficiency. However, in many cases, EPBs are either not calculated or not integrated in a register within national spatial data infrastructure (NSDI). This complicates policy development and planning for both local and national governments, which may result in numerous complications. The objective of this paper is twofold: firstly, to design a building energy data model as an extension of NSDI in T & uuml;rkiye and then implementing and populating it with real data taken from energy performance certificates from the Tuzla District in Istanbul; and secondly, to develop energy performance prediction models with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms (i.e., Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) in order to estimate the overall performance scores of the buildings. The model's findings demonstrated robust predictive accuracy, achieving an R-2 of 0.818 (XGBoost) and performance metrics of RMSE = 5.153, MAE = 2.886, and MAPE = 3.369. These results substantiate the model's reliability in estimating targeted building energy performance scores. These predictions can be used to provide a comprehensive overview of districts in terms of EPB and inform the development of road maps at the district, city, or national level. Furthermore, the predictions can support the development of EPB-related legislation, facilitate the design of incentive and sanction mechanisms, and promote broader sustainability and climate mitigation goals in a practical manner. Nevertheless, as a limitation of this study, the model has only been tested in a single district, which restricts its generalizability; it should therefore be evaluated in other areas to confirm its applicability.

LA English
DT Article

AB This study delves deeply into the impact of the application of biomass new energy in rural buildings on overall sustainability, particularly in terms of energy conservation and emission reduction. The research comprehensively considers the energy value and carbon emissions of biomass energy throughout its entire life cycle, from production to consumption, ensuring the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the assessment. The study employs a random forest model, going through steps such as data preprocessing (cleaning, feature selection, standardization), data splitting (80 % training set, 20 % test set), model training (random sampling, feature selection, decision tree construction), hyperparameter optimization (number of decision trees, maximum depth, number of features), and performance evaluation (mean squared error, coefficient of determination, etc.), to ensure the scientificity and accuracy of the model. Key parameters include the number of decision trees (100-500), maximum depth, and the number of features selected, which are optimized through grid search and random search to enhance the model's predictive ability. The main research findings include: Based on the data from the case study in this paper, at a 95 % confidence level, it is believed that farmers' heating and cooking costs could be reduced by 30 % to 50 % through the use of biomass energy. According to the technological improvements, market conditions, policy changes and other factors in this case, a rural community can reduce about 3000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually by replacing 1000 tons of coal with biomass energy, with an error range of 3 % to 6 %. Replacing coal with biomass energy can reduce sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions by approximately 90 %. Future research will deepen data analysis, explore the impact of economic activities and energy prices and other factors, and focus on the issue of carbon emissions growth in the long-term operation of biomass energy systems to explore effective emission reduction pathways.

AB This paper developed an artificial intelligence home environment monitoring system by using the Android Studio development platform. A database was constructed within a server to store sensor data. The proposed system comprises multiple sensors, a message queueing telemetry transport (MQTT) communication protocol, cloud data storage and computation, and end device control. A mobile application was developed using MongoDB software, which is a file-oriented NoSQL database management system developed using C++. This system represents a new database for processing big sensor data. The k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm was used to impute missing data. Node-RED development software was used within the server as a data-receiving, storage, and computing environment that is convenient to manage and maintain. Data on indoor temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide concentrations are transmitted to a mobile phone application through the MQTT communication protocol for real-time display and monitoring. The system can control a fan or warning light through the mobile application to maintain ambient temperature inside the house and to warn users of emergencies. A long short-term memory (LSTM) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN) model were used to predict indoor temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide concentrations. Average relative errors in the predicted values of humidity and carbon dioxide concentration were approximately 0.0415% and 0.134%, respectively, for data storage using the KNN algorithm. For indoor temperature prediction, the LSTM model had a mean absolute percentage error of 0.180% and a root-mean-squared error of 0.042 degrees C. The CNN-LSTM model had a mean absolute percentage error of 1.370% and a root-mean-squared error of 0.117 degrees C.

AB The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought tremendous benefits to corporate development. However, its energy-intensive characteristic has also led to a sharp increase in corporate energy consumption (CEC). Research on how to mitigate the impact of AI on CEC is crucial. This paper utilizes text analysis to collect information on AI development from the annual reports of listed companies. Based on this information, an AI development index at the enterprise level is constructed and matched with the energy consumption data of listed companies, resulting in panel data from 2013 to 2022. Subsequently, the Panel Smooth Transition Regression (PSTR) model is employed to explore the nonlinear relationship between AI and CEC under different levels of human capital (HC). The research results indicate that when HC is at a low level, AI significantly increases CEC. After HC exceeds the threshold, the effect of AI on increasing CEC is weakened, but it still contributes to an increase. These results remain valid after a series of robustness checks. The results of heterogeneity tests show that an increase in HC can also lead AI to reduce the consumption of high-pollution energy. The human capital effects and AI's technological progress effects are more pronounced in state-owned enterprises and enterprises in the high-tech industry. This paper provides theoretical support for the notion that HC can promote AI development and reduce AI's energy consumption in enterprises.

AB Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) is a promising technology for mitigating global climate change. The catalyst layer (CL), where the reduction reaction occurs, plays a pivotal role in determining mass transport and electrochemical performance. However, accurately characterizing local structures and quantifying mass transport remains a significant challenge. To address these limitations, a systematic characterization framework based on deep learning (DL) is proposed. Five semantic segmentation models, including Segformer and DeepLabV3plus, were compared with conventional image processing techniques, among which DeepLabV3plus achieved the highest segmentation accuracy (> 91.29%), significantly outperforming traditional thresholding methods (72.35%-77.42%). Experimental validation via mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) confirmed its capability to precisely extract key structural parameters, such as porosity and pore size distribution. Furthermore, a series of ionomer content gradient experiments revealed that a CL with an ionomer/catalyst (I/C) ratio of 0.2 had the optimal pore network structure. Numerical simulations and electrochemical tests demonstrated that this CL enabled a twofold increase in gas diffusion distance, thereby promoting long-range mass transport and significantly enhancing CO production rates. This work establishes a multi-scale analysis framework integrating "structural characterization, mass transport simulation, and performance validation," offering both theoretical insights and practical guidance for the rational design of CO2RR CLs.

TI Research on Coalbed Methane Production Forecasting Based on GCN-BiGRU Parallel Architecture-Taking Fukang Baiyanghe Mining Area in Xinjiang as an Example

AB As a low-carbon and clean energy source, Coalbed methane (CBM) is of great significance in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, optimizing the energy structure, safeguarding mine safety, and promoting the transformation to a green economy to achieve sustainable development. Coalbed methane (CBM) in Xinjiang's steeply dipping coal seams is abundant but difficult to predict due to complex geology and distinct gas flow behaviors, making traditional methods ineffective. This study proposes GCN-BiGRU, a parallel dual-module model integrating seepage mechanics, reservoir engineering, geological structures, and production history. The GCN module models wells as nodes, using geological attributes and spatial distances to capture inter-well interference; the BiGRU module extracts temporal dependencies from production sequences. An adaptive fusion mechanism dynamically combines spatiotemporal features for robust prediction. Validated on Baiyanghe block data, the model achieved MAE 59.04, RMSE 94.25, and improved accuracy from 64.47% to 92.8% as training wells increased from 20 to 84. It also showed strong transferability to independent sub-regions, enabling real-time prediction and scenario analysis for CBM development and reservoir management.

AB Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions peaked significantly in the last few decades, leading to environmental issues like global warming and climate change. Soccer stadiums are highly densely populated and consume significant amounts of energy, which results in emitting a large amount of GHG. It is crucial, therefore, to find an efficient way to optimize these emissions. Soccer (football) stadiums are densely populated facilities that consume vast amounts of energy, resulting in considerable GHG emissions; however, identifying effective strategies to optimize and reduce these emissions remains a gap in the literature. This study, describes rational approaches to optimize the reduction of GHG emissions and understand its mechanism in soccer stadiums in Qatar. This is driven by the data collected from global systems (F & eacute;d & eacute;ration Internationale de Football Association [FIFA] reports and global sustainability assessment system) and local ones (Qatar Football Association and the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, in addition to the local stadiums and clubs in Qatar). Various variables were considered, and also hybrid systems of principal component analysis (PCA) and machine learning (ML) approaches were used for the optimization process in five stadiums: Stadium 974, Al Janoub, Al Bayt, Lusail Stadium, and Education City Stadium. The study employed a PCA-assisted ML framework to identify key sustainability factors and predict the impact of interventions on emissions for these five stadiums. The results demonstrate a successful reduction of GHG emissions by 20%-40% and an improvement in CO2 offsetting by 40%-100%, besides increasing water conservation to 70%-95% and boosting renewable energy integration from 15% to 100% in Qatar's stadium. These results could be used as an initial platform for promoting carbon footprint reduction in other stadiums worldwide. In summary, the findings offer a practical roadmap for stadium managers and policymakers to achieve significant GHG emission cuts while enhancing sustainability performance.

TI EcoMRL: Deep reinforcement learning-based traffic signal control for urban air quality
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Air quality; multi-agent deep reinforcement learning; traffic signal control
ID emission
AB As greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from road networks significantly impact the urban environment, there has been a growing interest in integrating environmental factors into traffic controls. Traffic signal control (TSC) is an effective method to reduce air pollution by managing traffic congestion. Accordingly, several recent studies have applied artificial intelligence to TSC to improve traffic efficiency. Despite these efforts, there are a few limitations on the existing studies. First of all, a number of recent studies focus only on traffic performance rather than environmental effects. However, in some cases, the objective function related to traffic efficiency can have an adverse effect on the environment. Furthermore, the variable nature of emissions based on traffic demand is rarely considered. To address these issues, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning-based TSC to minimize GHGs in traffic networks. To this end, we first identify vehicle's stop and delay as key factors in traffic efficiency that critically influence air quality. Subsequently, we integrate these factors into our model's reward function. To validate the proposed model, we conduct experiments under various demand scenarios featuring different traffic volume levels. The results show that the proposed model outperforms comparative control methods in two aspects: traffic performance and environmental sustainability. Especially at a high congestion level, the proposed model reduces average delay time by 11.9-16.1% and increases total throughput by 11.5%. Additionally, it significantly lowers total CO2 emissions by up to 8.9% and average emissions by up to 18.3%.

AB Energy-efficient building retrofitting is crucial in reducing carbon emissions and enhancing sustainability. This study presents a novel Deep Learning-based Explainable AI model for energy efficiency classification and retrofit recommendation. Our model integrates a neural network with L2 regularisation, dropout layers, learning rate scheduling, and the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for class balancing, ensuring robust generalisation. The model is trained on an extensive dataset of buildings from the EPC Dataset - Region Lombardy, Italy, classifying structures into energy-efficient (A4) and non-energy-efficient (D-G) classes. The proposed model achieved a test accuracy of 99.95%, surpassing conventional machine learning and hybrid AI approaches in the literature. Additionally, it provides more accuracy by incorporating SHAP-based explainability to interpret model decisions and identify the key factors influencing energy efficiency. Counterfactual explanations provide personalised retrofit recommendations, focusing on insulation, renewable energy adoption, and efficient lighting solutions. The insights from this study provide a transparent, interpretable AI model that supports decisionmakers, policymakers, and stakeholders in optimising retrofitting strategies for sustainable urban development.

AB The substantial energy consumption and associated CO2 emissions from industrial operations pose significant environmental and economic challenges for factories and surrounding communities. Within the context of industrial energy management, the steel industry represents a major energy consumer. The imperative to optimize energy use in this sector is driven by a combination of environmental concerns, economic incentives, and technological advancements. This study presents a machine learning model that integrates the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) with multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) to forecast electric energy consumption. Utilizing a dataset comprising 35,040 real-world energy consumption records from Gwangyang Steelworks in South Korea, the model was benchmarked against other regression techniques (ridge, lasso, and elastic-net), demonstrating that the proposed WOA-MARS approach achieves a significant improvement in the RMSE (vs. elastic-net or lasso regression techniques) while maintaining interpretability through hinge function analysis. The WOA-tuned MARS model achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9972, underscoring its effectiveness for energy optimization in steel manufacturing. The key findings reveal that CO2 emissions and reactive power variables are the strongest predictors.

AB Routinely used production scheduling methods face significant challenges when addressing increasing demands for customized production. Flexible scheduling provides enterprises with a means to respond to the dynamic organization of production resources and the rapid demand variability inherent in customized manufacturing scenarios. CarbonDTMAS, an acronym for Carbon Emission-oriented Digital Twin Multi-Agent System enhanced by large language models, represents the platform proposed in this research. It aims to improve the collaborative optimization capabilities of flexible manufacturing workshops, with a particular focus on addressing carbon emission mitigation and dynamic scheduling optimization. Initially, a multi-agent self-organizing negotiation mechanism is developed to exploit domain-specific knowledge, particularly related to carbon emissions. This mechanism enhances agents' autonomous perception and interaction capabilities within flexible workshop environments. Subsequently, a multi-objective scheduling decision algorithm is introduced, which comprehensively integrates key scheduling factors, including task and machine features as well as historical carbon emission data, into the decision-making process. Finally, an adaptive learning algorithm is introduced to improve model's responsiveness to uncertain events, such as machine failures and order insertions. The case study demonstrates that compared to benchmark models and rule-based systems, CarbonDTMAS achieves superior performance in reducing tardiness time, balancing workload balance, and minimizing carbon emissions.

AB Over the years, population growth has led to a sharp rise in electricity demand, which in turn has increased the use of fossil fuels, the main source of Greenhouse gas emissions. Renewable energy offers a cleaner alternative, helping reduce these emissions and lessen the impact of climate change. While recent studies primarily focus on the direct correlation between Greenhouse gas emissions and temperature elevation, this study takes a new approach by breaking the analysis into two stages. The first stage investigates the relationship between Greenhouse gas concentrations and the suppression of solar radiation trapped in the atmosphere. Subsequently, the second stage links trapped solar radiation with average temperature patterns. Two mathematical models with 95 % prediction accuracy are developed to estimate the reduction in trapped solar radiation from existing RE projects and predict resulting temperature changes. To improve the prediction accuracy, multiple Machine learning models, namely Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and kernel Naive Bayes, were utilized to predict the average temperature based on the two features, Greenhouse gas and the trapped solar radiation. Neural Network Clustering was also employed to capture nonlinear interactions between CO2 and solar radiation. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional methods while aligning with climate physics principles. The paper also addresses the impact of the climate change phenomenon on the evaporation rate in Jordan as a case study, offering insights into its regional environmental effects.

AB The transportation sector in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) is a major contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, driven by the country's heavy reliance on oil and fossil fuels. Transitioning to a green and sustainable transport system is critical for reducing emissions and aligning with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 goals of diversifying its economy and promoting environmental sustainability. Thus, this research examined the adoption of a green sustainable transport system to reduce GHG emissions and reduce dependence on fossil fuels for sustainable development in the KSA. The study evaluates various factors and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based eco-driving solutions to systematically implement green transportation systems. In this study, the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) method is applied to evaluate the five factors and eighteen sub-factors crucial for developing a green transportation system in the country. Next, the Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS) method is used to prioritize the most significant AI-based eco-driving solutions for the implementation of smart and green transportation in KSA. The findings of the FAHP show that environmental impact (33 %) is the most crucial factor, followed by regulatory compliance (21.3 %) and economic viability (16.9 %). The FTOPSIS indicates that the smart navigation system (CCi = 0.682) is the most critical AI-based eco-driving solution because this can help reduce GHG emissions and increase the efficiency of traffic regulation in the country. The electric and hybrid vehicle integration (CCi = 0.585) and carbon footprint tracking systems (CCi = 0.355) are the next most significant solutions. This study is helpful in reducing GHG emissions, supporting sustainable development, and guiding policymakers toward effective green transport initiatives.

AB Employing digital technology to achieve carbon emission reduction is a promising approach. This study combines two methods, including a systematic literature review (SLR) and empirical analysis to study the multiple paths of firm digitalisation to achieve carbon emission reduction through management activities. First, we employ an SLR method to identify the applications of digital technology for carbon emission reduction practice and the multiple paths of carbon emission reduction through management activities. We then empirically test the relationship between firm digitalisation, management activities and carbon emission reduction. The relevant findings are twofold. (1) The SLR reveals that artificial intelligence is the most effective technology to achieve carbon emission reduction, followed by the Internet of Things, big data analytics and cloud computing. These technologies often collaborate synergistically to achieve carbon emission reduction goals. (2) The SLR and empirical analysis reveal that firm digitalisation achieves carbon emission reduction through three management activities, including production operation management such as energy forecasts, resource control and preventive maintenance; innovation management such as process, energy and technological innovation; and logistics and supply chain management such as packaging management.

AB Operational building decarbonization is challenging due to complex weather conditions and occupation uncertainty. This paper introduces a precise optimization framework integrating the building information modelling technique and intelligent algorithms to dynamically predict multi-scenario building carbon emissions and optimize the building emissions performance considering building zones and weather conditions. Firstly, the onsite data and building information modeling-supported building emissions simulation data are collected for model training. Secondly, using intelligent algorithms, zone-based hourly carbon emissions and multi-scenario carbon emissions prediction are conducted simultaneously. Thirdly, the optimal decarbonization strategies are conducted using intelligent algorithms under various weather conditions. This framework has been verified for decarbonization in a high-rise operational building. The results reveal that: (1) The carbon emissions prediction is highly consistent with the ground truth after considering the sub-zone correlations; the R2 for the west, south, and east zones are 0.900, 0.900, and 0.942, respectively; (2) The surrogate models can accurately predict carbon emissions and thermal comforts with all R2 are higher than 0.912. The optimization rate of the building reaches 59.2 % while the outdoor temperature is above 35 degrees C. (3) In the many-objective optimization model, considering occupation uncertainty makes the strategy close to the actual situation, reaching the decarbonization by 6815.23 kg compared to the empirical operation for the cooling period. This work provides a new path for operational building precise management and control-oriented optimization decarbonization.

AB Machine-learning (ML) inference services are vital for artificial intelligence (AI) applications on edge devices. However, there are challenges to balance between maintaining high inference accuracy and minimizing carbon emissions. To foster green AI services, we introduce a novel framework that taps into green energy sources, empowering Internet of Things (IoT) devices to execute inference tasks at the network's edge. In the context of multitask concurrent scheduling, our methodology seeks to simultaneously optimize both the inference accuracy and carbon footprint of all inference tasks. To support this endeavor, we propose a unique incentive constraint that ensures equitable allocation of computing resources for IoT devices equipped with energy harvesting modules, thereby promoting efficient collaboration. Furthermore, recognizing the system's dynamic nature and fluctuating availability of green energy, we introduce the carbon-aware online inference task offloading algorithm (OTOA). This algorithm, anchored in the Lyapunov optimization method, leverages a graph-based offloading strategy, amalgamating elements from the two-sided matching method, to derive an approximate optimal solution using real-time data. Our meticulous theoretical evaluations and in-depth experiments with real-world datasets affirm OTOA's superiority over existing approaches.

TI TPLLM: A traffic prediction framework based on pretrained Large Language Models

AB Traffic prediction constitutes a critical component in sustainable urban data analysis, playing a pivotal role in optimizing transportation systems for reduced carbon emissions and improved energy efficiency. The precision of prevailing deep learning-driven traffic prediction models typically improves as the volume of training data increases. However, the procurement of comprehensive spatiotemporal datasets for traffic is often fraught with challenges, primarily stemming from the substantial costs associated with data collection and retention. This limitation severely hinders the deployment of models in regions with insufficient historical data. Consequently, developing a model that can achieve accurate predictions and good generalization ability in areas with limited historical traffic data is a challenging problem. It is noteworthy that the rapidly advancing pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) of recent years demonstrate exceptional proficiency in cross-modality knowledge transfer and few-shot learning. Recognizing the sequential nature of traffic data, similar to language, we introduce TPLLM, a novel traffic prediction framework leveraging LLMs. In this framework, we construct a sequence embedding layer based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a graph embedding layer based on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to extract sequence features and spatial features, respectively. These are subsequently integrated to form inputs that are suitable for LLMs. A Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning approach is applied to TPLLM, thereby facilitating efficient learning and minimizing computational demands. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that TPLLM exhibits commendable performance in both full-sample and few-shot prediction scenarios.

AB Sustainable modelling to reduce carbon emissions from heavy computations is being adopted in machine learning communities. However, this concept has not been considered in process-based model communities, with carbon emissions rarely monitored and reported. This study developed ProcessC, a multi-platform program to monitor energy usage and carbon emissions in process-based models' simulations. ProcessC was tested through a case study involving a process-based model, RZ-SHAW, for winter artificial drainage simulation. Results indicated that the RZ-SHAW model consumed 115 times more energy and released 29,397 times more carbon emissions compared to machine learning (ML) models for the winter artificial drainage simulation. The study suggests deploying computing systems in regions with low grid carbon intensity, choosing energy-efficient systems, and reducing simulation time as potential solutions for a more carbon-sustainable modelling. The findings from the current study urge the process-based community to commence considering and reporting carbon emissions in future modelling studies.

ID spatial association
AB Wind power is essential for achieving carbon neutrality, yet forecasting its future distribution-related mitigation potential is challenging due to the often-overlooked development mechanisms marked by spatial heterogeneity and path dependence. To address this, we first harmonized the China Onshore Wind Turbine (COWT) dataset, which comprises 153,722 turbines installed from 1984 to 2023. Using explainable machine learning methods, we find that the long-term national wind farm expansion was guided by wind resource availability, while infrastructure drove short-term agglomeration. Based on projected wind turbine distribution in the future, scenario analyses suggest that wind power could reduce emissions by 938-995 Mt CO2 in 2060, with the northern regions contributing 45%-52% of the total reduction. Context-dependent simulations highlight the best mitigation benefits when prioritizing high-quality wind resources in future layouts. Our framework for systematically understanding China's onshore wind power development provides a transferable paradigm for similar studies.

TI Optimization of carbon footprint management model of electric power enterprises based on artificial intelligence
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID performance
AB This study intends to optimize the carbon footprint management model of power enterprises through artificial intelligence (AI) technology to help the scientific formulation of carbon emission reduction strategies. Firstly, a carbon footprint calculation model based on big data and AI is established, and then machine learning algorithm is used to deeply mine the carbon emission data of power enterprises to identify the main influencing factors and emission reduction opportunities. Finally, the driver-state-response (DSR) model is used to evaluate the carbon audit of the power industry and comprehensively analyze the effect of carbon emission reduction. Taking China Electric Power Resources and Datang International Electric Power Company as examples, this study uses the comprehensive evaluation method of entropy weight- technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). China Electric Power Resources Company has outstanding performance in promoting renewable energy, with its comprehensive evaluation index rising from 0.5458 in 2020 to 0.627 in 2022, while the evaluation index of Datang International Electric Power Company fluctuated and dropped to 0.421 in 2021. The research conclusion reveals the actual achievements and existing problems of power enterprises in energy saving and emission reduction, and provides reliable carbon information for the government, enterprises, and the public. The main innovation of this study lies in: using artificial intelligence technology to build a carbon footprint calculation model, combining with the data of International Energy Agency Carbon Dioxide (IEA CO2) emission database, and using machine learning algorithm to deeply mine the important factors in carbon emission data, thus putting forward a carbon audit evaluation system of power enterprises based on DSR model. This study not only fills the blank of carbon emission management methods in the power industry, but also provides a new perspective and basis for the government and enterprises to formulate carbon emission reduction strategies.

AB Industrial decarbonization is critical for achieving net-zero goals. The carbon dioxide electrochemical reduction reaction (CO2RR) is a promising approach for converting CO2 into high-value chemicals, offering the potential for decarbonizing industrial processes toward a sustainable, carbon-neutral future. However, developing CO2RR catalysts with high selectivity and activity remains a challenge due to the complexity of finding such catalysts and the inefficiency of traditional computational or experimental approaches. Here, we present a methodology integrating density functional theory (DFT) calculations, deep learning models, and an active learning strategy to rapidly screen high-performance catalysts. The proposed methodology is then demonstrated on graphene-based single-atom catalysts for selective CO2 electroreduction to methanol. First, we conduct systematic binding energy calculations for 3045 single-atom catalysts to identify thermodynamically stable catalysts as the design space. We then use a graph neural network, fine-tuned with a specialized adsorption energy database, to predict the relative activity and selectivity of the candidate catalysts. An autonomous active learning framework is used to facilitate the exploration of designs. After six learning cycles and 2180 adsorption calculations across 15 intermediates, we develop a surrogate model that identifies four novel catalysts on the Pareto front of activity and selectivity. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging a domain foundation model with an active learning framework and holds potential to significantly accelerate the discovery of high-performance CO2RR catalysts.

AB Accurate power demand prediction is essential for energy management in the energy sector, but it is difficult due to the factors such as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. CNN-LSTM (Convolutional neural networklong short-term memory) neural network has demonstrated impressive performance but faces limitations in explaining its prediction results. Although XAI (explainable artificial intelligence) techniques enhance understanding through feature importance, they primarily focus on correlation rather than causality among variables in the deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose a causal XAI method for CNN-LSTM neural network with attention mechanism to predict power demand. Bayesian network is employed to provide the causal explanation with domain knowledge and relationships among observed variables and deep learning parameters (e.g., class activation maps and attention weights). Experiments on two real datasets such as UCI (University of California, Irvine) individual household electricity dataset and REFIT (Regulatory Fitness and Performance programme of the European Commission) dataset show improvements of average 34.84 % and 13.63 %, respectively. It also confirms that the proposed method not only significantly outperforms state-of-theart models in terms of prediction accuracy but also provides a causal explanation of the prediction outcome in terms of peak power usage, savings, and stability based on the observation windows, which provides actionable insight for end users to achieve power efficiency.

AB Improving energy efficiency is a major concern in residential buildings for economic prosperity and environmental stability. Despite growing interest in this area, limited research has been conducted to systematically identify the primary factors that influence residential energy efficiency at scale, leaving a significant research gap. This paper addresses the gap by exploring the key determinant factors of energy efficiency in residential properties using a large-scale energy performance certificate dataset. Dimensionality reduction and feature selection techniques were used to pinpoint the key predictors of energy efficiency. The consistent results emphasise the importance of CO2 emissions per floor area, current energy consumption, heating cost current, and CO2 emissions current as primary determinants, alongside factors such as total floor area, lighting cost, and heated rooms. Further, machine learning models revealed that Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM deliver the lowest mean square error scores of 6.305, 6.023, 7.733, 5.477, and 5.575, respectively, and demonstrated the effectiveness of advanced algorithms in forecasting energy performance. These findings provide valuable data-driven insights for stakeholders seeking to enhance energy efficiency in residential buildings. Additionally, a customised machine learning interface was developed to visualise the multifaceted data analyses and model evaluations, promoting informed decision-making.

AB The increasing energy demand and costs in the industrial sector necessitate effective energy management strategies. This study investigates a food processing company with an on-site cogeneration system, which faces challenges of high energy costs and fluctuating energy demand due to its seasonal production. During off-peak seasons, surplus energy is generated and frequently sold at reduced rates, thereby increasing operational inefficiencies. Conversely, during on-peak seasons, the company faces heightened energy demands and increased costs, further complicating energy management and impacting overall operational effectiveness. To address these challenges, an energy consumption forecasting model (ECFM) has been developed which employs Quantile Regression (QR) as a statistical method and different machine learning (ML) algorithms, including Decision Trees (DT), Boosted Trees, Bagged Trees, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Although QR is an effective method for handling non-normally distributed data, it is inadequate for capturing the high volatility of energy consumption in this study. Among the ML models, the bi-layered ANN demonstrated the most effective performance achieving the lowest forecasting errors and demonstrating a 52.42% reduction in CO2 emissions. This reduction is consistent with the company's decarbonization strategies and regulatory compliance goals. The findings highlight the potential of advanced ML models, particularly the bi-layered ANN, to enhance the accuracy of energy forecasting, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and create competitive advantages in industrial settings. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the integration of operational efficiency with environmental sustainability in energy management practices. It demonstrates the potential of advanced forecasting models to support the development of robust and sustainable energy solutions across a range of industrial contexts.

AB Decision-making in building energy systems critically depends on the predictive accuracy of relevant time-series models. In scenarios lacking extensive data from a target building, foundation models (FMs) represent a promising technology that can leverage prior knowledge from vast and diverse pre-training datasets to construct accurate probabilistic predictors for use in decision-making tools. This paper investigates the applicability and fine-tuning strategies of time-series foundation models (TSFMs) in building energy forecasting, using CHRONOS as a case study. We analyze both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning approaches, particularly low-rank adaptation (LoRA), by using real-world data from a commercial net-zero energy building to capture signals such as room occupancy, carbon emissions, plug loads, and HVAC energy consumption. Our analysis reveals that the zero-shot predictive performance of TSFMs is generally suboptimal. To address this shortcoming, we demonstrate that employing either full fine-tuning or parameter-efficient fine-tuning significantly enhances forecasting accuracy, even with limited historical data. Notably, fine-tuning with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) substantially reduces computational costs without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, fine-tuned CHRONOS TSFMs consistently outperform state-of-the-art deep forecasting models (e.g., temporal fusion transformers) in accuracy, robustness, and generalization across varying building zones and seasonal conditions. These results underline the efficacy of TSFMs for practical, data-constrained building energy management systems, enabling improved decision-making in pursuit of energy efficiency and sustainability.

AB Under complex manufacturing conditions, facility operations often rely on expert experience to optimize parameter adjustments, thus demanding human effort and lacking efficiency. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) offers insights into AI decision-making and predictions influencing facility efficiency. With heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GA), XAI enables solving optimization problems and identifying optimal parameters. This study introduces an XAI-based facility control system (XAI-FCS) that automates defining high-efficiency conditions, thereby replacing traditional methods. XAI-FCS applies these conditions as constraints for GA optimization, ensuring efficient operations, reducing energy consumption (EC) by 30.8 %, and lowering carbon emissions. It also enables parameter adjustments aligned with production schedules, saving time and costs and enhancing production line efficiency. XAI-FCS provides a reliable, efficient solution for modern manufacturing operations, reducing reliance on manual expertise while optimizing energy and operational performance.

AB As the IMO and the EU strengthen carbon emission regulations, eco-friendly voyage planning is increasingly recognized by ship owners as one of the most important performance factors of the vessel fleet. The eco-friendly voyage planning aims to reduce carbon emissions and fuel consumption while satisfying voyage constraints. In this study, a novel route waypoint optimization method is proposed, which combines a fuel consumption forecasting model based on the Transformer and a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for adaptive waypoint planning. The developed framework suggests a multi-objective methodology unlike the traditional approaches where a single objective is sought after, which characterizes fuel efficiency against navigational safety and operational simplicity. The methodology consists of three sequential phases. First, the transformer model is employed to predict ship fuel consumption using navigational and environmental data. Next, the predicted consumption values are utilized as a reward function in a PPO-based reinforcement learning framework to generate fuel-efficient routes. Finally, the number and placement of waypoints are further optimized with respect to terrain and bathymetric constraints, improving the practicality and safety of the navigational plan. The results show that the proposed method could decrease average fuel consumption by up to 11.33% across three real-world case studies: Busan-Rotterdam, Busan-Los Angeles, and Mokpo-Houston, compared to AIS-based routes. The transformer model outperformed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Random Forest baselines with the highest prediction accuracy, achieving an R2 score of 86.75%. This study is the first to incorporate transformer-based forecasting into reinforcement learning for maritime route planning and demonstrates how the method adaptively controls waypoint density in response to environmental and geographical conditions. These results support the practical application of the approach in smart ship navigation systems aligned with IMO's decarbonization goals.

AB The design of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems involves a balance among numerous indicators, particularly in academic buildings with a heightened demand for light and thermal comfort. Conventionally, enhancing comfort with heating and cooling interventions substantially elevates carbon emissions. Thus, it is crucial to develop a theoretical model to optimize the performance of BIPV systems during the initial design phase. This research endeavors to establish a data-driven approach encompassing simulation, prediction, and optimization, melding machine learning with various optimization algorithms to derive Pareto-front solutions, optimal schemes, and design optimization ranges. By applying this approach to a case study of an academic building in cold region, aimed at augmenting light and thermal comfort while curtailing carbon emissions and energy payback time. The results show that (1) the optimized solution reduces carbon emission by 27.71 kgCO2/ m2, increases light comfort by 22.65 %, and energy payback time is 9.36 years, keeping thermal comfort stable; (2) Window height, classroom height, and shading panel angle are identified as key factors in building performance; (3) LGBM and AGE-MOEA algorithms enhance prediction and optimization efficiency of in BIPV system. These findings provide advanced design solutions for academic buildings, optimizing carbon emissions and cost efficiency under climate change while ensuring comfort. Additionally, they offer a scientific theoretical reference for BIPV system design across various periods.
